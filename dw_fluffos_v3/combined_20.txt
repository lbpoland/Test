=== Content from Starting_location ===

From the [[#Travel Agency]] in [[Pumpkin Town]] you can get information, choose your start location and then teleport to your starting location.

Your '''starting location''' determines your '''nationality'''. Warning: '''This cannot be changed'''.


The current list of available start nations is: [[#Howondaland]], [[#Djelibeybi]], [[#Morpork]], [[#Lancre]], [[#Ephebe]], [[#Klatch]], [[#Agatea]], [[#Omnia]], [[#Brindisi]], [[#Istanzia]], [[#Uberwald]], [[#D'reg]], [[#Tsort]] and [[#Genua]].

If a nation or a region within a nation is very rural or not currently in the game, the new player will start in a nearby town or city.  The player's native area and accent will still be evident.

Some nations and regions are more challenging than others.  Players who are new to the Discworld MUD are encouraged to choose an easier location, although they should take guild locations and languages into account when choosing where to enter the Disc.  It is certainly possible to start in any of the offered starting locations no matter how experienced or inexperienced you are.  However, a person who is new to the Disc may find it less frustrating to begin in or near a city with many guild facilities and easy ways to earn money and experience.

You will enter the Disc at the starting location that corresponds to each nation, speaking the [[languages|language]] of your starting nation with your region's [[accent]].  Any remaining money from [[Pumpkin Town]] will be converted into the [[currency]] of your starting location.

If you are overwhelmed with the choices available, keep in mind that {{fontcolor|green|'''[[#Ankh-Morpork]] is a very good start place for new players.'''}} '''[[#Bes Pelargic]] is also a good place to start, although travel to the rest of the world is more difficult.'''

Description
     Welcome to the Pumpkin Town Travel Agency!  This is the place where   
     you can leave Pumpkin Town and choose a place to go to in the real    
     game.  You have to choose both a nation to start in (this determines  
     your language and accent), and a region in this nation (which often   
     determines your starting place).                                      
     You can get information about nations and regions with the info       
     command (see the syntax above, or the examples at the bottom of this  
     helpfile), and choose your location with the choose command.  After   
     having done this, you can use "enter door" to go to your chosen       
     location!                                                             
                                                                           
     For an overview of all the nationalities, you can also read the       
     tutorial in this room (type "tutorial").  To find out more about the  
     available regions, you will still have to use the info command.       

A Word of Warning
     Once you step through the door, you will never be able to come back to
     Pumpkin Town.  Therefore, it is wise to have done the guild tasks in  
     Guilds Grove (east, east, southeast from here, and then into the      
     buildings), and trained your combat with the training dummy (east,    
     south from here).  It is also wise to have a torch (can be obtained in
     the night club, east, north, west, west) and a satchel or something   
     comparable from the equipment emporium (east, northeast, east).  If   
     you want to become a priest, you may also have to change your         
     alignment - you can do this in the temple in Guilds Grove.            
     You can get or do all of these things in the rest of the game, but it 
     will be harder!                                                       

Random
     You can choose to go to a random location with the "choose random"    
     command.  However, this is NOT a good choice for first time players,  
     as it can land you at really dangerous locations!  Don't take this    
     option unless you're absolutely sure.                                 

Examples
     info

Description
     Upon leaving the newbie area and entering [[Discworld]], everyone must    
     choose a [[nationality]] for their character.  Your nationality is in     
     principle unchangeable and determines where in the world you start, as
     well as the [[language]] you are fluent in and your accent.               
                                                                           
     There are 13 nations (and corresponding nationalities): Agatea,       
     Djelibeybi, Dreg, Ephebe, Genua, Howondaland, Istanzia, Klatch,       
     Lancre, Morpork, Omnia, Tsort and Uberwald.                           
     Each of these nations have one or more regions.  The choice for a     
     particular region does not have an influence on the language or money 
     you start with, but might result in a different starting location.    
     This is also the location where the [[godmother]] will bring you to when  
     you request her help.                                                 
                                                                           
     Below follows a description of each of the nationalities.             

Agatean
     The Counterweight Continent is a prosperous empire, far across the    
     ocean.  Forests of sapient pearwood grow in a country where gold is   
     commonplace and disobedience is a grave offence.  The empire is ringed
     by a massive wall, there to keep out the hordes of bloodsucking       
     foreign vampire ghosts that are all that exist outside of Agatea.     
                                                                           
     Agatean characters begin the game with Agatean currency and speaking  
     [[Agatean]].  They all start in [[Bes Pelargic]].                             

Djelian
     A river kingdom, a thousand times as long as it is wide, [[Djelibeybi]] is
     built on pyramids and history.  Depending on how you count time, and  
     whether you consider recycled time as good as the fresh stuff,        
     [[Djelibeybi]] may be as old as the Disc itself, or it may have only been 
     around for a few tens of thousands of years.                          
                                                                           
     Djelian characters begin the game with Djelian currency and speaking  
     [[Djelian]].  They all start in [[Djelibeybi]].                               

Dreg
     The D'regs are a nomadic desert tribe of [[Klatch]].  Very warlike, fierce
     and honourable.  If a D'reg is your friend, he's your friend for      
     life.  If he is your enemy, he is your enemy for life, which is now   
     about twenty seconds.                                                 
                                                                           
     D'reg characters begin the game with the Djelian currency and speaking
     [[Djelian]].  They start in [[Djelibeybi]].                                   

Ephebian
     A land of marble, dates and olives, with a myriad of quarrelsome gods,
     [[Ephebe]] tries to be the most cultured and civilised place on the Disc. 
     They created the ideas of democracy and the philosophical method.  As 
     a country, Ephebe prefers debate and rationality to warfare, but is   
     fully capable of turning its developments to more martial uses.       
                                                                           
     Ephebian characters begin the game with Ephebian currency and speaking
     [[Ephebian]].  They all start in [[Il Drim]], except those who choose to start
     in the Ephebian desert.                                               
                                                                           
     Starting in [[Ephebe]] is difficult, and is not recommended except for    
     experienced players desiring a challenge.                             

Genuan
     The Diamond City, jewel of the [[Vieux river]] and home to the best and   
     most magically active gumbo anywhere.  [[Genua]] has recently escaped the 
     mirrored fist of Lilith de Tempscire and has begun to recover into its
     own city as opposed to being a collection of story-fragments woven    
     into the illusion of one.                                             
                                                                           
     Genuan characters begin the game with Genuan currency and speaking    
     [[Morporkian]].  Start locations depend on the region.                    

Howondalandish
     Past even darkest Klatch, there are the jungles of Howondaland, with  
     ruined temples, priests of demon snake gods and many lost tribes      
     (known to their neighbors by names that tend to be variants on 'people
     who should have turned left rather than right at the fork in the      
     river'.)  It's a barbarian's playground, a demon snake god's backyard 
     and the worst nightmare or fondest dream of many a virgin sacrifice.  
     (Depending on their views on barbarians and demon snake gods.)        
                                                                           
     Howondalandish characters begin the game with Djelian currency and    
     speaking [[Djelian]].  They start in [[Djelibeybi]].                          

Istanzian
     For a long time the nation of Istanzia lived in fear of the Omnian    
     Empire which nibbled at the Istanzian villages on their border.       
     Istanzia is a river kingdom based along the Istanzia river flowing    
     into the Circle Sea from the mountains of Klatchistan.                
                                                                           
     Istanzian characters begin the game with Ephebian currency and        
     speaking [[Ephebian]].  They start in [[Il Drim]].                            
                                                                           
     Warning: Starting in Istanzia is difficult and is not recommended     
     except for experienced players desiring a challenge.                  

Klatchian
     The plains, jungles and deserts of [[Klatch]] stretch rimwards from the   
     [[Circle Sea]].  Home to giraffes, elephants and far stranger things,     
     Klatch also has more than its share of nomadic tribes, lost           
     civilizations and decadent city-states.                               
                                                                           
     Klatchian characters begin the game with Djelian currency and speaking
     [[Djelian]].  They all start in [[Djelibeybi]].                               

Lancrastian
     A mountain kingdom high in the [[Ramtops]], [[Lancre]] is the home of many    
     small villages as well as being the traditional seat of [[witch]]craft.   
     Under the reign of King Verence, the kingdom has begun to make quiet  
     steps toward the modern era, but on a whole, remains a rural and      
     simple place.                                                         
                                                                           
     Lancrastian characters begin the game with Lancre currency and        
     speaking [[Morporkian]].  Start locations depend on the region.           

Morporkian
     Morporkians are from the [[Sto Plains]], the fertile area around the river
     Ankh.  While the plains are dotted with many villages and numerous    
     cities, the greatest of them is the metropolis of [[Ankh-Morpork]], a city
     that will give you anything, provided that you have money in your     
     pocket.                                                               
                                                                           
     Morporkian characters begin the game with Morporkian currency and     
     speaking [[Morporkian]].  Start locations depend on the region.           

Omnian
     Omnia is the land of the Great God Om and his followers.  Once a      
     warlike and expansionist theocracy, following a costly war with       
     Ephebe, they abruptly ceased crusading against their neighbors.       
     Nowadays, most Omnians seen are not soldiers bent on subjugating the  
     infidel, but missionaries trying to convert them with pamphlets about 
     Om's glory.                                                           
                                                                           
     Omnian characters begin the game with Ephebian currency and speaking  
     Ephebian.  They all start in [[Il Drim]].                                 
                                                                           
     Warning: Starting in Omnia is difficult and is not recommended except 
     for experienced players desiring a challenge.                         

Tsortian
     On the rimward side of the Circle Sea, Tsort is a large desert country
     bordered on the north by the [[Klatch]]ian Empire and the south by the    
     river kingdom of [[Djelibeybi]].                                          
                                                                           
     Tsortian characters begin the game with Djelian currency and speaking

Uberwaldean
     Dark forests, craggy lightning-chased peaks, werewolves, vampires and 
     friendly men stitched together out of body parts.  [[Uberwald]] is a      
     dangerous and gloomy place, with only a few villages huddling, in     
     constant fear of things that bump and howl and bite in the night.     
                                                                           
     Uberwaldian characters begin the game with Lancre currency and        
     speaking [[Uberwaldean]].  They all start in [[Escrow]].                      
                                                                           
     Warning: Starting in Uberwald is EXTREMELY difficult and is not       
     recommended except for experienced players desiring a challenge.

=Howandaland=
 When people talk of the 'dark and mysterious continent of [[Klatch]]' it is [[Howondaland]] they are referring to.  Its borders are imprecise, since they begin where those of other countries on the Hubwards coast of Klatch fade away (that is to say, where surveyors don't come back and mapmakers are found nailed upside down to a tree). 
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#Zabingo]]
 People in this nation speak [[Djelian]].

==Zabingo==
[[Zabingo]] is probably the only part of Howondaland that has made it onto a map, mostly due to it being a large coastal town that can be approached from the sea, rather than through the jungles.  The principal exports are pepper, cloves, and other exotic spices, and the principal imports are slaves and trouble. 

Choosing this region will make you start in [[Djelibeybi]], since an economic downturn makes it impractical to have a dashing pirate captain capture you and sell you into slavery in Zabingo itself. 

Howonda characters begin the game with Djelian currency and speaking [[Djelian]].

Many religions are present in [[Djelibeybi]], and those wishing to join the priesthood of [[Hat]], the Vulture-Headed God of Unexpected Guests, will find their main temple here.  Most other playable [[priest]]hoods also have a smaller presence here.

As well as joining the priesthood, adventurers may join the [[Djelian Guard]] (a warrior specialisation) in [[Djelibeybi]].  Not far from the city can also be found outposts of the [[Hashishim]] (an assassin specialisation) and the [[Klatchian Foreign Legion]] (a warrior specialisation).  Whilst facilities currently exist in [[Djelibeybi]] for [[thieves]], [[witches]] and [[wizards]]; those wishing to play these guilds are advised to choose another start location.

{{fontcolor|red|'''Warning: Starting in Djelibeybi is of moderate difficulty.  Whilst it is not equipped with every facility you might need, it is by no means the hardest place that a new player could start in.'''&lt;br/>
'''Please be aware that the killing of cats, priests and shopkeepers is forbidden in Djelibeybi.  Consequences for breaking these local taboos could result in you being thrown to the [[Djelibeybi crocodile pit|deadly crocodiles]].  Stealing is also forbidden, and will result in you being tossed into the surrounding terrains when caught.'''}}

=Djelibeybi=
 [[Djelibeybi]], literally Child of the [[Djel]] after the river flowing through this land, is also called the Kingdom of the Sun and the Old Kingdom.  It is a slim country situated on the great continent of [[Klatch]], nestled along the river Djel. 
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#Djelibeybi]]
  * [[#the upper Djel valley]]
 People in this nation speak [[Djelian]]. 

==Djelibeybi==
The capital of Djelibeybi, also called [[Djelibeybi]], was the seat of power for the ruling Pharaohs whilst to the north the huge pyramids of the necropolis line the boundary between land and sky. 

Djelian characters begin the game with Djelian currency and speaking [[Djelian]].

Many religions are present in [[Djelibeybi]], and those wishing to join the priesthood of [[Hat]], the Vulture-Headed God of Unexpected Guests, will find their main temple here.  Most other playable [[priest]]hoods also have a smaller presence here--the one exception being [[Pishe]].

As well as joining the priesthood, adventurers may join the [[Djelian Guard]] (a warrior specialisation) in [[Djelibeybi]].  Not far from the city can also be found outposts of the [[Hashishim]] (an assassin specialisation) and the [[Klatchian Foreign Legion]] (a warrior specialisation).  Whilst facilities currently exist in [[Djelibeybi]] for [[thieves]], [[witches]] and [[wizards]]; those wishing to play these guilds are advised to choose another start location.

{{fontcolor|red|'''Warning: Starting in Djelibeybi is of moderate difficulty.  Whilst it is not equipped with every facility you might need, it is by no means the hardest place that a new player could start in.'''&lt;br/>
'''Please be aware that the killing of cats, priests and shopkeepers is forbidden in Djelibeybi.  Consequences for breaking these local taboos could result in you being thrown to the [[Djelibeybi crocodile pit|deadly crocodiles]].  Stealing is also forbidden, and will result in you being tossed into the surrounding terrains when caught.'''}}

==the upper Djel valley==
The Djel valley stretches 500 miles from the mountains of Elharib to the Circle Sea.  The fertile soils of the Djel are home to crops of melon and garlic as far as the eye can see (or looking away from the river, for about half a mile until the harsh desert takes over). 

Choosing this region will make you start in the capital, [[Djelibeybi]].

=Morpork=
 [[Morpork]] is the area around [[Ankh-Morpork]] and contains most of the small cities of the [[Sto Plains]].  This includes places like [[Sto Lat]] and [[Sto Helit]], as well as [[Holy Wood]] and [[Rham Nitz]].  [[Ankh-Morpork]] is the biggest city in this hemidisc.
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#Sto Helit]]
  * [[#Sto Lat]]
  * [[#Sto Plains]]
  * [[#Ankh-Morpork]]
 People in this nation speak [[Morporkian]]. 

==Sto Helit==
[[Sto Helit]] is a small town on the [[Sto Plains]], nestled in amongst the cabbage fields of that area, which provide the town's main industry and its reputation. It is further away from [[Ankh-Morpork]] than its sister city [[Sto Lat]] is, so is perhaps not one of the easiest places to start. 

As Sto Helit is not open yet, players choosing it as a start location will start in [[Sto Lat]] instead. 

Characters from Sto Helit start out with Morporkian currency and speaking Morporkian. 

==Sto Lat==
While [[Sto Lat]] is quite a bit smaller than [[Ankh-Morpork]], it's close enough for its denizens to easily travel back and forth between the two cities.  Sto Lat is far more dangerous however, especially at night when cats and muggers roam the streets, pouncing on easy targets.  Fortunately the cats are rather wussy, and the muggers like to check people out before attacking them, giving the wary wanderer time to leave before danger strikes.  Fatal Row should be avoided at any time of day or night, as should the cabbage warehouse outside the east side of Sto Lat. 

[[Wizard]]ly studies may be engaged in a house on King's Road, and potential [[priests]] can join the [[Pishe]] Priesthood in Princess Park.  While the [[Thieves' Guild]] does operate an outpost in Sto Lat, it was forced to go underground to avoid detection.  To become a [[witch]], lasses can visit [[Mum Blithesome]] on Grave's Hope to request a [[taliswoman]] that will teleport them to [[Granny Weatherwax]] in [[Bad Ass]].

It is illegal to kill people in Sto Lat, though as is the case in every type of crime, it's not illegal if no one knows you did it.  That said, Sto Lat citizens in good standing are quite eager to assist the guards by reporting any illegal activities they witness.

Players with the Sto Lat nationality start out with Morporkian currency and speaking [[Morporkian]].

==Sto Plains==
The city of [[Ankh-Morpork]] is surrounded by the vast, flat Sto Plains, populated mostly by cabbages, cabbages and the occasional quail.  A few scattered towns lie about the expanse: the larger ones are one-horse.  It is not an easy location to start from, but it's not far from Ankh-Morpork, so the difficulty is not insuperable.  People choosing to start in the [[Sto Plains]] will start in the tiny farming town of [[Dinky]].

[[Dinky]] lacks any guilds to join or interesting shops.  The nearest cities with useful services are [[Sto Lat]] and [[Ankh-Morpork]], which can be reached via the [[carriage]] that stops just outside of the tavern in Dinky, at the crossroads.

[[Dinky]] itself is quite safe, though travelling through the Plains during the night can be quite dangerous, especially if you encounter bandits on the roads outside of the towns.  There is a carriage stop however, where people can catch a [[carriage]] that will provide safe transportation to various nearby cities.  Dinky is too small to have an organized watch or guard, so anything goes.  Likewise, the [[Sto Plains]] are wild and uninhabited by anyone that might be interested in abiding by laws, much less making them.

Characters from the [[Sto Plains]] start out with Morporkian currency and speaking [[Morporkian]].

==Ankh-Morpork==
[[Ankh-Morpork]] is the largest city on the Disc, and quite possibly offers the greatest number of services.  It is probably the easiest place for people to begin their existence, if one of the dirtiest.  There is little danger to be found in the city, and it is easy to avoid.  Newcomers should stay far away from the [[Shades]], located in the west end of the city off Cockbill Street, and wandering on the solid parts of the river is also not recommended.   

Many guilds flourish in [[Ankh-Morpork]], including the [[Wizards' Guild]] on Sator Square, the [[Assassins' Guild]] on Filigree Street, and the [[Thieves' Guild]] on the Street of Alchemists.  Wannabe [[warriors]] can join the [[Ankh-Morpork Palace Guard]] at the Patricians' Palace or the [[Weapon Masters' Court]] on Vagabond Street, and [[priests]] can join up at various temples throughout the city, mostly located on Street of Small Gods.  While [[witches]] cannot be trained in Ankh-Morpork, they can visit [[Gennie Applebottom]] on Holofernes street to get a magical [[taliswoman]] to teleport them to [[Granny Weatherwax]]'s cottage in [[Bad Ass]].

Local laws tend to be quite relaxed in [[Ankh-Morpork]].  [[Thieves]] may steal if they are licensed and not on leave, though anyone else is likely to quickly regret any thefts they initiate.  [[Assassins]], also, may inhume guild-sanctioned targets once they are certified.  Killing people is generally accepted, though the Ankh-Morpork City Watch will arrest anyone caught in the act, possibly after a nice beating.

Characters from Ankh-Morpork begin the game with Morporkian currency and speaking [[Morporkian]]. 

 {{fontcolor|green|'''Ankh-Morpork is a very good start place for new players.'''}}

=Lancre=
 [[Lancre Kingdom]] is the main kingdom of the [[Ramtops]].  It is primarily a large forested area with rocky cliffs, small villages, and kings with spots on their hands.  The [[guilds]] are not very well represented in this area, except for the [[Witches' Guild]] and some scattered outposts for [[Warriors]].
 
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#Lancre]]
  * [[#Moorland]]
  * [[#Hangdog]]
  * [[#Feruss]]
  * [[#Mad Wolf]]
  * [[#Copperhead]]
  * [[#Saddleback]]
  * [[#Bad Ass]]
  * [[#Mad Stoat]]
  * [[#Creel Springs]]
  * [[#Slice]]
  * [[#Ohulan-Cutash]]
  * [[#Razorback]]
  * [[#Blackglass]]
  * [[#Powderknife]]
  * [[#Slippery Hollow]]
  * [[#Valley of the Listening Monks]]
  * [[#Brass Neck]]
 People in this nation speak [[Morporkian]].

==Lancre==
[[Lancre Town|Lancre]] is out in the boondocks, it is technically a town, but compared to everything around it, it's a city.  It is actually the main town of the entire kingdom of [[Lancre]], located on the edge of Lancre forest high on the windswept, snowy moors of the [[Ramtops]].  The whole town has a feeling of country air about it. 

Adventurers looking for adventure can join the [[Lancre Highland Regiment]] in town, or wander down the road to [[Bad Ass]] to become a [[witch]].  A [[carriage]] stopping in centre of town can take travellers to more populated regions.

Although no one will mind if you kill less important townspeople, you may find life difficult in Lancre if you kill anyone else.

Those choosing to begin their existence in [[Lancre Town]] will start out with Lancrastian currency and knowledge of the [[Morporkian]] language. 

{{fontcolor|red|'''Note: The [[Ramtops]] villages are generally moderately difficult to start out in, although those considering a [[witch]]y occupation may find the location convenient and suitable to their needs.'''}}

==Moorland==
Out in the wilderness, between the [[Dancers]] and the [[Standing Stone]], lies the [[Lancre Moor]].  The [[moorland]] here is desolate, with the odd troll wandering around, but there are some nomadic travellers who make the moor their home, some educating their children themselves, some sending them further afield in the hope they'll better themselves. 

Adventurers originating from the moorland will begin in the safety of the town of [[Lancre Town|Lancre]]. 

Those choosing to originate from the moorland will start out with Lancrastian currency and knowledge of the [[Morporkian]] language. 

{{fontcolor|red|'''Note: The [[Ramtops]] villages are generally moderately difficult to start out in, although those considering a [[witch]]y occupation may find the location convenient and suitable to their needs.'''}}

==Hangdog==
Following the Lancre river to its source up in the [[Ramtop mountains]] will take you to the tiny settlement of [[Hangdog]].  Rumour has it, many years ago, the local inhabitants thought that a dog that came in on a trading cart was actually a spy from [[Uberwald]], so they executed it by a barbaric method.  The dog was made to dangle by its paws, whilst a group of artists drew a picture, and then, after all that, it had another dog try to make a date with it. Fortunately, this method has died out, due to some very awful drawings.

Hangdog is inaccessible currently, and adventurers choosing to start there will find themselves in [[Lancre Town]]. 

Those choosing to originate from Hangdog will start out with Lancrastian currency and knowledge of the [[Morporkian]] language. 

{{fontcolor|red|'''Note: The [[Ramtops]] villages are generally moderately difficult to start out in, although those considering a [[witch]]y occupation may find the location convenient and suitable to their needs.'''}}

==Feruss== 
Hidden in a tiny valley, very close to the [[Dancers]], lies the village of [[Feruss]]. The village seems to be made entirely out of wood and straw, there is no smithy, and no sign of anything even slightly metallic anywhere in the village. The local carpenters do a roaring trade, as do the local firefighters.  To see the fire crew running from the local stream with their buckets is a sight to behold. 

Feruss is not open to outsiders, and people wishing to start there will begin in [[Lancre Town]] instead. 

Those choosing to originate from Feruss will start out with Lancrastian currency and knowledge of the [[Morporkian]] language. 

{{fontcolor|red|'''Note: The [[Ramtops]] villages are generally moderately difficult to start out in, although those considering a [[witch]]y occupation may find the location convenient and suitable to their needs.'''}}
 
==Mad Wolf==
The village of [[Mad Wolf]] is famous for its hunting, and... well... little else. Rumours of wild-life that can be found nowhere else brings [[hunters]] from all over the [[Kingdom of Lancre]] to its tree-lined village lanes in search of that elusive kill that will make it all worthwhile. 

A [[carriage]] stop near the outskirts of town makes regular trips to more interesting locations.

Those choosing to begin their existence in Mad Wolf will start out with Lancrastian currency and knowledge of the [[Morporkian]] language. 

{{fontcolor|red|'''Note: The [[Ramtops]] villages are generally moderately difficult to start out in, although those considering a [[witch]]y occupation may find the location convenient and suitable to their needs.'''}}

==Copperhead==
More a mountain than a settlement, [[Copperhead]] is the home to a [[mining]] community of dwarfs, the most famous of whom is Carrot Ironfoundersson, who left to seek his fortune in [[Ankh-Morpork]]. 

Adventurers seeking to join a guild must journey elsewhere, but be warned that the roads may be dangerous after dark. 

Those choosing to originate from Copperhead will start out with Lancrastian currency and knowledge of the [[Morporkian]] language. 

{{fontcolor|red|'''Note: The [[Ramtops]] villages are generally moderately difficult to start out in, although those considering a [[witch]]y occupation may find the location convenient and suitable to their needs.'''}}

==Saddleback==
The Lancre Saddleback is one of the finest breeds of pig you'll find anywhere on Disc.  The lesser known village of [[Saddleback]] is hidden high up in the [[Ramtops]], where they only had the one breed of pig, and so no cross-breeding occurred (although plenty of in-breeding, and I don't mean the pigs). Coincidentally, the best bacon sandwiches on Disc also seem to come from here too. 

This town is not currently accessible due to an incident involving desperate mountain men and stampeding pigs, so people from Saddleback will start out in [[Lancre Town]]. 

Those choosing to originate from Saddleback will start out with Lancrastian currency and knowledge of the [[Morporkian]] language. 

{{fontcolor|red|'''Note: The [[Ramtops]] villages are generally moderately difficult to start out in, although those considering a [[witch]]y occupation may find the location convenient and suitable to their needs.'''}}

==Bad Ass==
[[Bad Ass]] is a small, friendly village high in the [[Ramtops]], where it's said the back door is always open, and the front door is only used by brides and corpses.  The village itself is famed for its [[witches]], and many a dark and midnight hag is often to be found wandering through it.  While the town itself is quite safe, the roads outside of town can be dangerous after dark. 

Adventurers seeking life as a [[witch]] can join up on the outskirts of town, however everyone else will need to travel to less rustic locations, usually west of Bad Ass, either by foot or via the Lancre Kingdom [[Carriage]].

Although the residents of Bad Ass are a fairly laid back lot, they do get a bit unhappy with people killing their neighbours.

Those choosing to begin their existence in Bad Ass will start out with Lancrastian currency and knowledge of the [[Morporkian]] language. 

{{fontcolor|red|'''Note: The [[Ramtops]] villages are generally moderately difficult to start out in, although those considering a [[witch]]y occupation may find the location convenient and suitable to their needs.'''}}

==Mad Stoat==
The village of [[Mad Stoat]] is a popular haunt with people of a somewhat... shady background.  The imposing bulk of the great Brandobas house casts its shadow over the village, and the shifty characters who frequent its depths lend a somewhat hard edge to life amongst Mad Stoat's thatched cottages. 

It is rumoured that an outpost for [[thieves]] can be found in the area, for the persistent searcher, though the occupants of such a den would undoubtedly meet any newcomers with swift violence.  A [[carriage]] stopping in Mad Stoat can take wanderers either deeper into [[Lancre]] or toward the [[Sto Plains]].

==Creel Springs==
[[Creel Springs]], well known for its [[hot springs]], has always been a popular destination for the weary traveller.  Its sulphur infused waters are the source of the ever pervasive mist that wisps its way through the houses situated in a ring around the pools.  While the town is quite safe, [[brigand]]s may attack travellers on the roads outside the town after dark. 

Adventurers seeking to join a guild must journey elsewhere, either on the roads or via the [[carriage]] that stops at the south end of town.

==Slice==
Up towards [[Slice village|Slice]] can be found the Place Where The Sun Does Not Shine, which is found between a Rock and a Hard Place.  Such a hard-headed approach to metaphor is a trait peculiar to dwarfs and people from Slice... you can usually tell which you may be dealing with by the number of fingers on their hands. Villages of Slice are notoriously inbred, its seclusion lending it a somewhat... relaxed approach to matters of romance. 

{{Warning|This town has little to offer for those seeking adventure, aside from a deadly plummet for travellers not watching their step.}}

==Ohulan-Cutash==
[[Ohulan-Cutash]], or OC as it is affectionately known, is an uncivilized sprawl, located about fifteen miles from [[Lancre Town|Lancre]].  It often has people dropping in from the [[Ramtops]], and has a little market square where traders are always willing to rip people off... I mean trade with people. 

There is a slight religious contingent here too, with small temples dedicated to [[Gufnork]] and [[Sek]] nearby.  There are also rumours of an [[Assassins' Guild]] outpost nearby, though any potential members should probably join up at a more welcoming location.

==Razorback==
The village of [[Razorback]], high up in the [[Ramtop mountains]], is best known for the goat cheese that the village produces in its dairy.  Apart from the dairy, that's about all the village has to offer, apart from an inn, and stunning scenery, oh, and don't forget the cheese. 

A [[carriage]] stops in the midst of Razorback's modest town square, taking travellers to more... inhabited places.

==Blackglass==
[[Blackglass]] is a little village on the edge of [[Uberwald]].  The village has a number of points of interest, mainly the apples that grow there, a wide variety of delicious types coming from the orchard.  With it being so close to [[Uberwald]], danger lurks close by, and staying inside the town after dark is strongly recommended, as inexperienced adventurers will be easy prey for roaming [[brigand]]s. 

Joining any [[guilds]] requires travelling to a more hospitable locale, generally by heading north on the road starting at the southwest edge of town.  For safety, local authorities recommend catching the Lancre Kingdom Carriage at the [[carriage]] stop near the centre of town.

==Powderknife==
Perched high up in the Ramtop Mountains, the hamlet of [[Powderknife]] looks over the valley below, with breathtaking scenery of all of the [[Lancre]] Kingdom.  Oh, and a breathtaking, and (also lifetaking) drop too, if anyone were to put a foot wrong. 

Powderknife is currently closed to outsiders, however people from this town will begin in the town of [[Lancre Town|Lancre]] instead. 

Those choosing to originate from Powderknife will start out with Lancrastian currency and knowledge of the [[Morporkian]] language.

==Slippery Hollow==
The legend of [[Slippery Hollow]] is well-known throughout [[Lancre]], the collection of cottages there, inevitably connected in the traveller's mind with the legend of the [[headless horse rider]].  Nobody knows just why the horse is headless, although there is thought to be some connection with organized crime.

Mercifully newcomers begin inside Moon Under Water tavern, where they are safe (at least temporary). Don't go outside at night!

{{warning|At night if the [[Headless horse rider]] finds you it will [[behead]] you! It is very good at beheading.}}

==Valley of the Listening Monks==
The [[valley of the Listening Monks]] is located high among the farthest reaches of the [[Ramtops]].  A tiny village is nestled in the valley, near the ammonite-shaped temple the [[Temple of the Listening Monks|Listening monks]] inhabit.  Many dangers lurk (and spring, and growl, and smush) between the Valley and civilisation, and only one [[carriage]] route dares venture so far.  If not the deadliest place to begin life on the Disc, it is probably the most difficult.  Be sure to take a warm cloak! 

Those choosing to begin their existence in the Valley of the Listening Monks will start out with Lancrastian currency and knowledge of the [[Morporkian]] language. 

{{warning|Note: The Valley of the Listening Monks is in a very remote and inhospitable location high in the [[Ramtops]], and so is a difficult location for a new character to start.}}

==Brass Neck==
The village of [[Brass Neck]] is built in a crevice of land nestled into the sweeping spires of Leaping Mountain.  The village itself is like many such backwater [[Lancre]] locations - a forge serves as the focal point of all local activities.  Brass Neck is the birthplace of a former Archchancellor of Unseen University, and his old home has been converted into a comfortable inn for travellers on their way to and from the rest of the Kingdom.  The nearby roads can be deadly after dark, however this town is otherwise safe for travellers. 

While some outposts for warriors, thieves, and Pishites can be found nearby, most adventurers will need to travel elsewhere to pursue their dreams, either by road or on one of the carriages stopping near Brass Neck's nearly non-existent commercial district.

Those choosing to begin their existence in Brass Neck will start out with Lancrastian currency and knowledge of the [[Morporkian]] language.

=Ephebe=
 On the rimward side of the Circle Sea, [[Ephebe]] is a large desert country with little to say for itself other than its city, also known as Ephebe. A land of marble, dates and olives, with a myriad of quarrelsome [[gods]], Ephebe tries to be the most cultured and civilised place on the Disc.  They created the ideas of democracy and the philosophical method.  As a country, Ephebe prefers debate and rationality to warfare, but is fully capable of turning its developments to more martial uses.
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#Ephebe]]
  * [[#Erebos]]
  * [[#Crinix]]
  * [[#the Ephebian desert]]
  * [[#Heliodeliphilodelphiboschromenos]]
  * [[#Papylos]]
  * [[#an Ephebian ship]]
 People in this nation speak [[Ephebian]].

==Ephebe==
[[Ephebe]] is a tiny, but influential, state lying on the Rimward coast of the [[Circle Sea]], between [[Djelibeybi]] and [[Omnia]].  It is the land of the bourzuki (a kind of dog) and retsina (a kind of paint-thinner) and above all the land of philosophy. 

If you choose this region you will start in the harbour area of [[Ephebe]].

{{fontcolor|red|'''Although not the most difficult area to start in as a new player, it is not recommended for brand new players.'''}}

The [[Ephebian desert]] is vast, dry and pretty much empty save for several billion small [[gods]] and a few mad prophets. 

Players who choose this as their starting point will start in the [[Oasis]].

The city of [[Heliodeliphilodelphiboschromenos]], home of many vestigial virgins, sits out in the [[Ephebian desert]].

=Klatch=
 [[Klatch]] is the area on the rimwards side of the circle sea, an ancient country renowned for learning, scholarship, decadence, and vast empty deserts where the wind howls across the dunes with nothing to stop it but a few resigned camels. It covers this area and around the peninsula, though ignorant foreigners will refer to anything west of the [[Istanzia River]] as "Klatch". 
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#Al-Ybi]]
  * [[#the El Kinte peninsula]]
  * [[#Al Khali]]
  * [[#Otherz]]
  * [[#Gebra]]
  * [[#Eritor]]
 People in this nation speak [[Djelian]]. 

==Al-Ybi==
The city of [[Al-Ybi]] is an undistinguished Klatchian desert city, known in folklore as a place where criminals always claimed to have been when accused of a crime.  In Al-Ybi, it is said, the Klatchians invented the concept of zero. That tells history everything it needs to know about what there was to do in Al-Ybi of an evening. 

As the immigration staff were tragically assassinated last week and replacements have not yet been found, players choosing it as a start location will start in [[Djelibeybi]] instead. 

Klatchian characters begin the game with Djelian currency and speaking [[Djelian]]. 

Many religions are present in [[Djelibeybi]], and those wishing to join the priesthood of [[Hat]], the Vulture-Headed God of Unexpected Guests, will find their main temple here.  Most other playable [[priest]]hoods also have a smaller presence here.

As well as joining the priesthood, adventurers may join the [[Djelian Guard]] (a warrior specialisation) in [[Djelibeybi]].  Not far from the city can also be found outposts of the [[Hashishim]] (an assassin specialisation) and the [[Klatchian Foreign Legion]] (a warrior specialisation).  Whilst facilities currently exist in [[Djelibeybi]] for [[thieves]], [[witches]] and [[wizards]]; those wishing to play these guilds are advised to choose another start location.

{{fontcolor|red|'''Warning: Starting in Djelibeybi is of moderate difficulty.  Whilst it is not equipped with every facility you might need, it is by no means the hardest place that a new player could start in.'''&lt;br/>
'''Please be aware that the killing of cats, priests and shopkeepers is forbidden in Djelibeybi.  Consequences for breaking these local taboos could result in you being thrown to the [[Djelibeybi crocodile pit|deadly crocodiles]].  Stealing is also forbidden, and will result in you being tossed into the surrounding terrains when caught.'''}}

==the El Kinte peninsula==
The [[El Kinte]] peninsula is a broad, open area of undistinguished sand dunes, not quite achieving the full searing, scorching, sand-blasting dignity of the Ephebian or Tsortean deserts, but still quite adequate in the harsh, dry, vulture-haunted, dying-of-thirst stakes. 

As the immigration staff have lost the little stamp they need to use on your papers, players choosing it as a start location will start in [[Djelibeybi]] instead.

==Al Khali==
[[Al Khali]] is rather like [[Ankh-Morpork]], but with sand instead of mud, and is popularly called the Gateway to the mysterious continent of [[Klatch]].  The city is known for its wind, blowing from the vastness of the deserts and continents nearer the Rim.  A gentle but persistent breeze, it "carries aromatic messages from the heart of the continent, compounded of the chill of the deserts, the stink of the lions, the compost of the jungles and the flatulence of the wildebeest". 

As the immigration office staff appear to have been temporarily replaced with a comfy sofa by a freak accident with a magic ring, players choosing it as a start location will start in [[Djelibeybi]] instead.

==Otherz==
[[Otherz]] is one of those small, boring villages that only exist so that people can come from there.  Nobody ever moves there, and nobody ever moves back, partly because anyone who attempts it is treated with harsh suspicion.  After all, no good comes of leaving for forn parts. 

As the immigration staff were tarred and feathered when they attempted to visit for a preliminary census, players choosing it as a start location will start in [[Djelibeybi]] instead.

==Gebra==
The rose-red city of [[Gebra]], exactly seven-thirteenths as old as Time itself (or herself), was carved according to legend by the proud, noble forefathers of the first D'reg tribes before they abandoned shelters of stone for the trackless ways of the desert. 

As the immigration staff are currently in negotiations for a better reward package, players choosing it as a start location will start in [[Djelibeybi]] instead.

==Eritor==
[[Eritor]] is a lush, green city, built around the deepest, purest artesian well in [[Klatch]].  The plentiful water and sunlight mean that the city is surrounded by vineyards, and the rich golden Eldorado wine gives Eritor its reputation as the city of poets, dervishes, and drunkards.

=Agatea=
 With a population of about fifty million, the [[Agatean Empire]] is an old, cunning and very, very rich empire on the [[Counterweight Continent]], famous for its abundance of gold, octiron and sapient pearwood.  The Empire is not known for its hospitality, surrounded by a massive wall patrolled by the Heavenly Guard which performs the dual function of keeping foreigners out and the [[Agatean]]s in. From its capital city of Hunghung to its only seaport of [[Bes Pelargic]], everyone in the Empire knows his or her place. 
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#Sum Dim]]
  * [[#Hunghung]]
  * [[#Bes Pelargic]]
 People in this nation speak [[Agatean]]. 

==Sum Dim==
[[Sum Dim]] is the third largest city in the [[Agatean Empire]].  Thousands of miles away from the nearest contact with the Disc outside of the Empire, Sum Dim is Agatean tradition and culture at its purest.  Its distance from the capital, Hunghung, also allows for a certain element of illegal activity to go unpunished - however, the Imperial Guard are diligent as ever in ensuring the authority of the Emperor and the Serene Council is maintained lest this rebellious spark should encourage disobedience in the general populace. 

This city is not yet in game, if you choose it you will start in [[Bes Pelargic]]. 

Agatean characters begin the game with Agatean currency and speaking [[Agatean]]. 

==Hunghung==
The capital of the Agatean Empire, and the home of the Emperor and the heads of the major families, [[Hunghung]] is a huge, sprawling city with the fortress-like Forbidden City at its heart.  Here, the Serene Council and the Emperor's court play host to the majority of the acts of treachery and assassination which are meat and drink to the nobles of the Empire, while in the labyrinthine suburbs outside, the Imperial Guard keep watch and authority over the millions of peasants, merchants, and bureaucrats - all playing their part like cogs in a machine. 

This city is not yet in game, if you choose it you will start in [[Bes Pelargic]]. 

Agatean characters begin the game with Agatean currency and speaking [[Agatean]]. 

==Bes Pelargic==
[[Bes Pelargic]] is a major seaport of the rich and ancient [[Agatean Empire]].  In fact, it is the only sea port of the Agatean Empire.  With over half a million inhabitants, Bes Pelargic is home to noblemen, merchants, bureaucrats and criminals alike.  The five great [[Agatean family|families]] and the Emperor himself have a presence here in the form of their estates and the Imperial Palace, as does a thriving criminal underground in its hidden markets and danger-filled back alleys. 

Agatean characters begin the game with Agatean currency and speaking [[Agatean]].

=Omnia=
 [[Omnia]] is a dry country on the Klatchian coast, perfectly situated to bear the full brunt of the desert's winds and the desert's peculiar capacity to nourish gods.  One such, [[Om]], inspired a great monotheistic empire of millions, before the Prophet Brutha turned the Church to a different path, of respectful - if energetic - discussion, schism after schism, and Visiting the Infidel with [[Pamphlets]]. 
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#Il Drim]]
  * [[#Kom]]
 People in this nation speak [[Ephebian]]. 

==Il Drim==
[[Il Drim]] is a small fishing town that was at some point in its history engulfed by the Omnian Empire. 

Omnian characters begin the game with Ephebian currency and speaking [[Ephebian]]. 

{{fontcolor|red|'''Warning: Starting in Omnia is hard and is not recommended for new players.  The nearest guild facilities are in [[Djelibeybi]], and you will need to learn a new [[language]] to access many facilities.'''}}
 
==Kom==
The citadel of [[Kom]] extends for miles - temples, churches, schools, dormitories, gardens and towers.  It also has a lot of underground cellars, sewers, forgotten rooms, dead ends, spaces behind walls and natural caves.  There are very few steps in the citadel - the progress of many processions demands long, gentle slopes.  What stairs there are are shallow enough to allow for the faltering steps of very old men. 

An outbreak of a particularly nasty plague, causing the entire city to become overrun with rats, frogs, and door-to-door salesmen means that choosing this region will make you start in [[Il Drim]].

=Brindisi=
 Some way turnwise of [[Genua]], [[Brindisi]] is a colourful nation whose millenia of warfare, science, artistry and really really complicated politics have influenced countries Discwide.  No one really knows how this happened, as to all appearances Brindisi is and always has been interested in little but wine, women and song.  And very, very good food.  It is a land of olive trees, mountains and seaports, whose city squares teem with loud-voiced women and smell of garlic, oranges, coffee and basil.  Rumour has it some Brindisian chefs could even teach the Genuans a thing or two about seafood. 
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#Brindisi]]
 People in this nation speak [[Brindisian]]. 

==Brindisi==
The complex and ever-changing face of [[Brindisi]]an politics means that very little importance can ever be attached to cities or regions of origin, as they may not exist under the same name tomorrow.  Therefore, all Brindisians are, at present, simply Brindisians. 

Brindisian politics are currently so esoteric that it has managed to argue the entire country out of existence.   Until it pops back onto the map, any new adventurers will begin in [[Genua]]. 

Brindisian characters begin the game with Genuan currency and speaking [[Brindisian]]. 

{{fontcolor|red|'''Warning: Starting in Genua speaking a foreign language is very difficult; therefore this nationality is not recommended to any but experienced players.'''}}

=Istanzia=
 For a long time the nation of [[Istanzia]] lived in fear of the [[Omnian Empire]] which nibbled at the Istanzian villages on their border.  Istanzia is a river kingdom based along the Istanzia river flowing into the [[Circle Sea]] from the mountains of [[Klatchistan]]. 
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#Istanzia]]
 People in this nation speak [[Ephebian]].

==Istanzia==
The town of [[Istanzia]] sits on the Istanzia river close to where it runs into the [[Circle Sea]].

Choosing this region will make you start in the village of [[Il Drim]], because the citizens of Istanzia itself have locked the gates against Omnian missionaries and are busy pretending there's no-one in.

 [[Uberwald]] is a land of majestic forests and rocky mountains. It is also the home of terrified peasants, rabid werewolves and brutal vampires where the law of the land is the Lore. 
 
 {{Fontcolor|red|WARNING!  This is an EXTREMELY difficult location to start in.}}
 
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#Escrow]]
  * [[#Koom]]
  * [[#Bonk]]
  * [[#Uberwald]]
 People in this nation speak [[Uberwaldean]].

==Escrow==
One of the largest towns in [[Uberwald]], [[Escrow]] is a pleasant, sleepy town with most of the comforts of home and none of the hassles.  Sounds perfect, right? Unfortunately [[vampire]]s and [[werewolves]] think so as well.  Although adventurers will start in a pub unplagued by vampires, the rest of the town belongs to the undead all night.  Furthermore, the roads and forests surrounding Escrow are similarly deadly, hence it is highly recommended that adventurers not venture here, unless they wish to feed themselves to the locals. 

To join any guilds - or keep breathing, for that matter - adventurers should take the first carriage out of town that they can get on.

Despite the townfolks' willingness to live near werewolves and vampires, they are not very tolerant of being killed by adventurers.

Those from the town of Escrow start out with Lancrastian money and knowledge of the [[Uberwaldean]] language. 

{{Warning|Danger: THIS IS AN INSANELY DANGEROUS LOCATION FOR NEWBIES.  DO NOT START HERE UNLESS YOU ARE AN EXPERIENCED PLAYER SEEKING A CHALLENGE.  WHEN YOU DIE HERE YOU WILL NOT HAVE LIVES/INVENTORIES/EXPERIENCE REPLACED.}}
 
==Koom==
A region based around the [[Koom Gorge|Koom River]], the main settlement of which is [[Ham-on-Koom]].  Ham-on-Koom was originally a small fishing village whose economy was based on the fish that people could pull out of the Koom river.  However the recent concept of tourist, with all of its financial opportunities, transforms Ham-on-Koom into a small town every tourist season. 

Owing to frequent floods, landslides and huge and unexpected holes in the ground, people who come from here will start in [[Escrow]], which is at least safe in geological terms.  Starting in [[Escrow]] will give you Lancre money and a thorough knowledge of the [[Uberwaldean]] language.

{{Warning|Danger: THIS IS AN INSANELY DANGEROUS LOCATION FOR NEWBIES.  DO NOT START HERE UNLESS YOU ARE AN EXPERIENCED PLAYER SEEKING A CHALLENGE.  WHEN YOU DIE HERE YOU WILL NOT HAVE LIVES/INVENTORIES/EXPERIENCE REPLACED.}}

==Bonk==
A civilised city in the middle of a rugged forest, [[Bonk]] is a place run by [[dwarfs]], [[werewolves]] and [[vampires]] in a mostly working system of "I won't kill you if you don't kill me".  Bonkers will begin in the town of [[Escrow]]. 

As the city of Bonk is still debating whether [[werewolves]] or [[vampire]]s should rule, its natives will begin their existence in the town of [[Escrow]] with Lancrastian money and knowledge of the [[Uberwaldean]] language.

==Uberwald==

=D'reg=
 The [[D'regs]] are a nomadic desert tribe of [[Klatch]].  Very warlike, fierce and honourable.  If a D'reg is your friend, he's your friend for life.  If he is your enemy, he is your enemy for life, which is now about twenty seconds. 
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#somewhere in the desert]]
 People in this nation speak [[Djelian]]. 

==somewhere in the desert==
The [[D'regs]] are a wandering people, who scorn lines on [[maps]] and call no place home.  As such, any notion of birthplace is quickly forgotten.

Choosing this region will make you start in [[Djelibeybi]].

D'reg characters begin the game with Djelian currency and speaking [[Djelian]].

Many religions are present in [[Djelibeybi]], and those wishing to join the priesthood of [[Hat]], the Vulture-Headed God of Unexpected Guests, will find their main temple here.  Most other playable [[priest]]hoods also have a smaller presence here.

As well as joining the priesthood, adventurers may join the [[Djelian Guard]] (a warrior specialisation) in [[Djelibeybi]].  Not far from the city can also be found outposts of the [[Hashishim]] (an assassin specialisation) and the [[Klatchian Foreign Legion]] (a warrior specialisation).  Whilst facilities currently exist in [[Djelibeybi]] for [[thieves]], [[witches]] and [[wizards]]; those wishing to play these guilds are advised to choose another start location.

{{fontcolor|red|'''Warning: Starting in Djelibeybi is of moderate difficulty.  Whilst it is not equipped with every facility you might need, it is by no means the hardest place that a new player could start in.'''&lt;br/>
'''Please be aware that the killing of cats, priests and shopkeepers is forbidden in Djelibeybi.  Consequences for breaking these local taboos could result in you being thrown to the [[Djelibeybi crocodile pit|deadly crocodiles]].  Stealing is also forbidden, and will result in you being tossed into the surrounding terrains when caught.'''}}

  * [[#Erebos]]
  * [[#Tsort]]
 People in this nation speak [[Djelian]]. 

==Erebos==
The island of [[Erebos]] lies in constant turmoil with the countries of [[Ephebe]] and [[Tsort]] competing for its fertile land. 

Choosing this region will make you start in [[Djelibeybi]], because the navies of [[Ephebe]] and [[Tsort]] are both blockading the island, and suspected olive- or retsina-smugglers tend to be shot on sight. 

Tsortean characters begin the game with Djelian currency and speaking [[Djelian]].

Many religions are present in [[Djelibeybi]], and those wishing to join the priesthood of [[Hat]], the Vulture-Headed God of Unexpected Guests, will find their main temple here.  Most other playable [[priest]]hoods also have a smaller presence here.

==Tsort==
[[Tsort]] is the principal city of the Tsortean Empire, most notably renowned for the beautiful Eleanor of Tsort, the face that launched a thousand ships.

=Genua=
 The swampy lands known as [[Genua]] are scattered around the city of the same name. Renowned for the historical meddling of fairy godmothers, Genua is rife with the residual magic of fairy tales. 
 This nation has the following regions: 
  * [[#Bois]]
  * [[#Genua]]
 People in this nation speak [[Morporkian]]. 

==Bois==
[[Bois]] is a small village near the city of [[Genua]], and fairy tale creatures run wild.  There are no guilds in Bois, however adventurers can travel to less provincial locations via carriage or ferry.

Characters from Bois start the game with Genuan currency and speaking [[Morporkian]]. 

==Genua==
[[Genua]], the Diamond City, the Magic Kingdom, is the jewel of the swamps, and one of the main port cities of the widdershins coast of the Disc's central continent.  It is a city of civilisation and sophistication, a diamond of music and mirth, laughter and love, nestled on the delta of the mighty [[Vieux River]]. While quite idyllic, not all parts of the city are safe, especially the sewers.

Adventurers can join the ranks of the priests of [[Gapp]] or [[Hat]] here, or seek fame in the [[Musketeers]].  While it is possible to join the [[Thieves' Guild]] in Genua, it is very dangerous and not recommended.  The less scrupulous may also find a future with the Genuan assassins known as the [[Mano Rossa]].

Genuan characters start the game with Genuan currency and speaking [[Morporkian]].
