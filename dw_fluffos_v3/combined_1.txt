=== Content from Achievements ===

Achievements are rewards for participation within the game.  The achievements system was made available in December 2008.  More information about the [[History_-_Achievements_Go_Live|introduction of the achievements system]] is provided in the [[MUD_history|MUD history]] section.

Achievements are not [[quests]]; they do not require figuring out puzzle elements to complete, they are publicly [https://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/secure/achievements.c listed] and they can be freely discussed.

You can complete achievements by playing the game normally or by actively trying to complete them. Typically they are awarded for obtaining some skill levels, using guild abilities and doing one or more certain actions.

The innate command [[inform]] can be used to be notified of players from around the disc as they attain a moderate level or higher achievement.

==Overview==

Achievements are devided into categories based on the amount of time or difficulty needed to obtain them. Each category awards a different amount of [[XP]] and achievement points. The categories are:

=== Content from Action_points ===

==Overview==
During combat, each participant has an action point ''deficit'' associated with them.  Whenever that participant physically attacks or defends, their deficit increases, with the cost depending on various different factors.  Action points are replenished - reducing the deficit - at a (usually) constant rate with each round that passes.

Note that unlike all the other 'points' counters, action points levels can ''not'' be directly viewed by a player - there is no counter that will show up with 'score' or any other command.  The only way to gauge action point levels is via seeing the effects of having overly large or small deficits, as detailed below.

==Deficits, surpluses and running out of action points==
As action points are used, players acquire offensive and defensive action point defecits, equal to the difference between their current and maximum action point levels.

There are critical deficit thresholds associated with offensive and defensive actions, which are affected purely by the participant's [[Tactics#Attitude|tactics-attitude]].  The more aggressive attitudes permit the player to reach a higher deficit before Bad Things happen to their offense, but a lower deficit before Bad Things happen to their defence.  The more defensive attitudes cause the converse effect.

===Critical attacking level effects===
*If a participant has a significantly small deficit in relation to the critical offensive level, then they will make two attacks in a round.
*If a participant's deficit increases past the critical offensive level, then they will not attack at all that round.

===Critical defending level effects===
*Small deficits in relation to the critical defensive level do not confer any direct benefits (though it's always nice to have a surplus...).
*If a participant's defensive deficit increases beyond the critical defensive level, then that participant does not attempt to defend incoming attacks (the attacks automatically hit).

Note that the deficit level is to a certain extent self-correcting - if a fighter has used up too many action points, then their attack and defense rate will decrease, causing them to use less action points for a while.  Conversely, if they have plenty of action points to spare, then they will attack faster, using up action points at a faster rate.

==Action point cost and regeneration==
Barring effects from special attacks and spellcasting, all participants regenerate action points at the same constant rate. However, the action point cost of attacking and defending is variable based on the following modifiers.

===Attacking cost===
The following factors affect the cost of attacking:
*The attacker's bonus in [[fighting.special.tactics]] - higher levels reduce the action point cost.
*Their bonus in the appropriate [[fighting.melee|melee]] or [[fighting.range|ranged]] weapon skill.  Again, higher levels reduce the cost.
*The attack cost is increased in relation to the weight of the attacker's weapon.  This penalty is mitigated somewhat if the weapon is held in both hands.
*The attack cost is reduced if attacking with multiple weapons.

===Defending cost===
The following factors affect the cost of defending:
*The defender's bonus in [[fighting.special.tactics]] - higher levels reduce the action point cost.
*Their bonus in the appropriate [[fighting.defence|defence]] skill.  Again, higher levels reduce the cost.
*Various factors associated with their specific means of defense, ranging from [[burden]] to weapon weight.  See [[dodge]], [[parry]] and [[block]] for more details.
*If the defender defeats the attacker's 'to-hit' skillcheck by a large margin (ie. they 'easily' parry/dodge/block), then the cost of that defence is halved or (in extreme cases) zeroed.  Conversely, if they defeat the attacker by a very small margin ('only just manage to...'), then the cost of that defence is doubled.

===Spellcasting===
While spellcasting, a character regenerates ''no'' action points.  Note, however, that a player can spellcast no matter how great their action point deficit is.

==Other ways to affect one's own action points==
In general, performing almost any action will increase one's action point deficit - the more time you spend doing other things, the less time you have to engage in combat.  The following are particularly worthy of mention:
*Performing most forms of [[special|special attack]] will cause a significant increase in action point deficit.
*Casting spells also significantly increases action point deficit (in addition to not regenerating them).
*[[Berserk]] drastically increases either action point regeneration or the critical deficit levels{{research}}.
*Attacking an opponent will increase your opponent's action points deficit if they try to defend. If they have less action points, they can make fewer attacks. If they are making fewer attacks, you will spend fewer action points on defense.  This will let you make more atacks...  
** If you're being attacked by a group of NPCs, you may have a huge action point deficit; this may make it difficult, if not nearly impossible, to fight back.
** Traveling in a group of players or using [[minion|minions]] can cause your opponent to have a high action points deficit.

==Ways to affect one's opponent's action points==
There are various special commands which specifically act to consume an opponent's action points:
*[[Trip]]
*[[Shove]]
*[[Feint]]

==Defending and protecting other players==
[[Defend]]ing or [[protect]]ing others incurs a significant extra action point cost, above and beyond the standard cost of performing a defensive action.  This reflects the time taken to leap in front of the person being defend/protected.
*Protecting incurs a set action point cost, ''very roughly'' equivalent to the cost of two attacks with reasonable skills.
*Defending incurs twice this cost (because it's a lot harder to get in the way ''and'' parry than just get in the way and be hit), in addition to the cost involved in parrying the attack.

'''Adventuring.movement.swimming''' is the skill which determines how well a player can swim, stay afloat, and some related things.{{Research}}

==Uses==
*Staying afloat (resist sinking down) with heavier inventory, as well as swimming up with heavier inventory.
**[[Burden]] is not a factor, only the '''weight''' of what you are holding / carrying / wearing. [[Burden]] depends not only on the weight of things, but also on your strength and if the items are held, carried or worn.
*Resisting being swept into another room by the current, where applicable.
*Swimming from room to room.
*Swimming at the [[Pishe Gardens]] or [[Brown Islands]] is rather safe.
*Trying to go down in water despite being light and floating.
*Dunking people or avoiding being dunked in the pool in [[Creel Springs]].

==Swimming Items==
There are some items that assist in swimming.
* [[Floaties]] (from [https://dw.daftjunk.com/items/index.php?shop=586 Creel Springs bathing shop]), being a [[witch]] or wearing a [[gold and red coral ring]] make a player more buoyant, making it easier to swim up, but harder to swim down.
* [[Swim rings]] also make a player more buoyant at the cost of making swimming harder. Available at the [https://dw.daftjunk.com/items/index.php?shop=181 AM Pishe temple shop].
* [[Fishy flippers]] are available in the [[Fish]] temple in the sunken ship below the [[Bes Pelargic]] harbour. When worn they should make it easier to move around in the water but harder on land.
* A shimmering fish scale bodysuit (it's a shirt) is also available from the [[Fish]] temple in the sunken ship but it is unclear if it helps to swim.
* The [[leather turtle mask]] from the [[T-Shop]] more than doubles the amount of time that can be spent underwater before damage begins being taken, and the total amount of time that can be spent underwater. When wearing it on land, there's spams about it messing with your breathing. It is unknown if it makes it harder to do anything.

==Spells and Rituals==
*[[Sacred Fins]] will increase the swimming skill of a player if they are not wearing anything on their hands or feet.
*[[Breathe Underwater]] or [[Kraken blood]] will allow a player to breathe underwater.
*[[Finneblaugh's Thaumic Float]] will allow a player to float over water instead of sinking into it. It does not work underwater however.

==Tips==
Holding weapons and wearing boots while swimming makes it more difficult to keep afloat or move. Unhold/remove such things first and then try moving before "remove all, drop all" if you find yourself in water unexpectedly.

==Notes==
[[Witches]] or others wearing a [[gold and red coral ring]] float more easily than other characters (or witches wearing a [[gold and red coral ring]]) making it far easier for them to not drown. However, it is harder for them to swim down.

[[Giant fruitbat]]s fly above the water, but they are not good swimmers, they can have difficulty following back out of water rooms and thus they can drown easily when submerged, especially when carrying heavy stuff. They should be left in a safe place before going swimming below the surface.

=== Content from Alias ===

Aliases allow you to write and store one or more commands under a name specified by you, allowing you to then execute those commands by typing the name.  This saves you a lot of time typing out complete commands, and as aliases can contain things such as parameter parsing and basic conditional clauses, you can make them as complex as needed.  

== Getting started ==

Typing 'alias' without any arguments will show you a list of your current aliases.
Typing 'alias &lt;alias name>' will show you the command or commands currently aliased to that alias name.

=== Creating an alias ===

For basic alias creation, simply type 'alias &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;'.  Before creating an alias, a useful check to perform is simply to type the name that you have in mind for your new alias.  Although aliases can generally be easily removed (see below), this simple check can make sure that you don't accidentially alias commands to a cardinal direction, etc.

''Single command example''

 > alias lw look Weston
 Added alias "lw"
 > alias lw
 lw: look Weston $*$

If you want to include multiple commands within a single alias, seperate the commands using a semi-colon, i.e. 'alias &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; &amp;lt;command1&amp;gt;;&amp;lt;command2&amp;gt;'

''Multiple command example''

 > alias lw look Weston;nudge Weston
 Changed alias "lw" from "look Weston $*$".
 > alias lw
 lw: look Weston;nudge Weston $*$

Note that some [[MUD client|MUD clients]] process the ; character as a new line symbol.  You will need to disable the parser or change the settings to create aliases using this symbol. 

=== Using an alias === 

You can execute a complicated command using a less complicated input with aliases, as tasks of any given complexity can be simplified into simple aliases.  Using the example above:

&lt;pre>> lw
Weston looks like a relatively recent recruit to both life as a Hunter and life as a smith. He's rather pale aside from his ink-stained fingers, and lacks the muscular physique usually associated with his new trade.  However he does look quite content with his situation, a slightly bewildered smile on his face more or less constantly.
He is in good shape.
He is standing.
Holding : a smith's hammer (left hand).
Wearing : a pair of hard leather boots, a pair of lightweight beige linen trousers, a starched white shirt and a brown leather belt.
You nudge Weston.&lt;/pre>

=== Removing an alias === 

To remove an alias, use the command 'unalias &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;'.  Continuing the example above:

 > unalias lw
 Successfully unaliased "lw":
 look Weston;nudge Weston $*$
 > lw
 What?
 >

== Alias Tricks &amp; Tips ==

===Cycling through aliases===
The following technique can be used to cycle an alias through different groups of commands.

The main alias:

&lt;pre>alias idling idlestuff1&lt;/pre>

The command aliases:

&lt;pre>alias idlestuff1 pray;alias idling idlestuff2

alias idlestuff2 perform major shield on me;perform major shield on me;perform major shield on me;perform major shield on me;perform major shield on me;put shield in pack;alias idling idlestuff3

alias idlestuff3 palm purple baton from pack;hold purple baton;slip purple baton to pack;perform major shield on me;pray;alias idling idlestuff1&lt;/pre>

Each time the 'idling' alias is used, it will call an 'idlestuff' alias. When that 'idlestuff' alias finishes, it will update the 'idling' alias to point to the next 'idlestuff' alias next time 'idling' is called.

===Temporarily disabling an alias===
You can prevent the executing of an alias by preceeing it with '''noalias''':
When you e.g. have aliased 'gp' to get something from your pack, you can still execute the original coded 'gp' to see your guildpoints:

&lt;pre>noalias gp&lt;/pre>

Or, for example, if you have an alias named "find" for performing [[Find]], and you go to the [[Capture the Flag]] arena and want to find someone's records, you'd use it like this:
&lt;pre>>syntax find
You have an alias called 'find'.
Forms of syntax available for the command 'find':
find &lt;player>  
>noalias find womble
Womble is not recorded as ever fighting in the arena.&lt;/pre>

===Quickly making temporary aliases===
Occasionally you may want to perform several commands right after each other without making a permanent alias for it.  In that case, something like this is helpful:

&lt;pre>alias parse alias _parsed $*$;_parsed&lt;/pre>

It creates a temporary alias of everything you put after "parse", then executes that alias.

You use it like this:
&lt;pre>>parse get damaged ring from pack;fix it;put it in pack&lt;/pre>

This is helpful for queuing up commands, as well as for repeating a set of commands a few times.

=== Using multiple arguments in the alias parameters ===
You can easily reference multiple argument using an alias like the below:
  alias test look $1$; wait; look $2$;

This will look at the first argument and then wait and then look at the second argument.
So that you can run a command like this:
  test stall sailor

One way to use it is to use it for another alias that can only be used for one target only and another alias to be used on a group like so, so it can be a knife throw alias for the first argument and an attack a group alias for the second argument like so:

  alias hu hurl throwing knife from scabbards at $*$;

  alias att hu $1$; attack $2$;

You can go up to 99 arguments it seems so from $1$ to $99$

=== Making aliases more general ===
If you don't have the same items with you all the time, you can refer to items by a more general name instead of their specific name.  You can "play instrument", "play held instrument" (if you might be carrying more than one), "judge weapon", "vurdere armour", "stab opponent with held weapon", "peek living thing" [1] (to be more specific you could "peek human"), "slip thing to here", and so on.  To account for items that may be on the floor in the room, you can add "my" ("play my instrument") to make sure you're only trying to do commands with items in your inventory.

For commands you want to do on multiple objects (such as "vurdere"), there are a few solutions (using "vurdere" as an example):
#"vurdere armour &amp; armour 2 &amp; armour 3" is the best way to handle this.  As long as it can find at least one piece of armour to execute the command on, it will work, and you know the maximum amount of gp you'll be spending on it ahead of time.
#"vurdere armour, armour 2, armour 3" is also a good way to make sure you vurdere ''exactly'' three pieces of armour... as long as it can find at least three.  Otherwise, the command fails. Only use this if you always have a predictable number of the items you want to target.
#"vurdere every armour" and "vurdere armours" both target every piece of armour you have out.  ("Every" can be more convenient for items with awkward plurals. If you want to use "every" with "my", you would "vurdere every my armour" (useless in this case, since the vurdere command will only look for items in your inventory).)  These are theoretically useful if you don't always have the same number of pieces of armour out, but the risk is that you may sometimes have too many for the amount of gp you have left--or just so many that you use more gp than you wanted to at that point in your alias, and end up being too tired to do one of your other commands.  This method is to be avoided if your alias is finely tuned.
#"vurdere random armour" is a nice twist that brings some automatic variety in your alias, though with random object/persons/weapons/... ;the rewarded xp can get more randomized too. "draw random weapon;appraise it;judge it;sheathe it;" ;)

To avoid using a command on one particular thing, you can use "except".  For example, if you want to perform a ritual on any living thing in the room except yourself, you could "perform &lt;ritual> on living thing except me".  Note, though, that the command will fail if it can't find the thing specified with "except": if you don't have a harp and you try to "play instrument except harp", you won't end up doing anything.

You can find another explanation of the various ways you can refer to things at {{Concepthelp|parser|help parser}}.

The alias command on its own will list what your current aliases are:

=== Content from Alignment ===

Being out of alignment--with your deity "annoyed" with you or worse--still prevents you from entering worshiper-only areas of your temple (which most instructor rooms are).

Newbies still in [[Pumpkin Town]] can change their alignment by rescuing or drowning beetles in the priests' guild area. This is a good idea if you're planning to join the priests' guild, and you can ''almost'' get to ideal Pishite or Sekkite alignment this way.

==Alignments for different deities==
Each deity has a different range of alignments they would like their [[priests]] and [[followers]] to stay inside.  You can check your alignment at any time with "[[score]] align" or "score alignment" ("score" by itself also contains this information)--this gives you a general indication of how good or evil you are, and tells you how happy (or not) your deity is with you.  If you are in alignment, they will be "very happy" or "pleased" with you.  If you're so far out of alignment as to not be able to perform rituals, they'll be "quite annoyed", or worse, "very angry" with you.  If you're on the edge, they'll be "a little concerned" about you, and rituals may be more difficult.

Alignment is visible to players on a scale that goes from 50 good to 50 evil using the [[Detect Alignment]] ritual, or in a number of steps using the "score align" command.

*[[Pishe]] wants her worshippers to be at least 3 good ("good") and up, being concerned at 2 good ("barely good") and 49 - 50 good (the very high end of "extremely good").  Perfect alignment is around 25 - 26 good, or around the beginning of the "extremely good" range.
*[[Gufnork]] wants his worshippers to be at least 3 good, but not more than about 11 - 12 good ("quite good"), being concerned at 2 good and 12 good. Perfect alignment is around 6 - 7 good ("quite good").
*[[Gapp]] wants his worshippers to be at least {{Research}} but not more than {{Research}}, being concerned {{Research}} and at {{Research}}. Perfect alignment is around 3 good.
*[[Sandelfon]] wants his worshippers to be less than 5 degrees good or evil ("good" or "evil"), being concerned at 4 degrees good or evil. Perfect alignment is around 0 good/evil ("neutral").
*[[Fish]] wants his worshippers to be between {{Research}}, being concerned at {{Research}}. Perfect alignment is around 0 - 1 evil.
*[[Hat]] wants his worshippers to be at least {{Research}}, but not more than about {{Research}}, being concerned at {{Research}}. Perfect alignment is around 5 evil.
*[[Sek]] wants his worshippers to be at least 3 evil and up, being concerned at 2 evil and 49 - 50 evil. Perfect alignment is around 26 evil.

The mud tracks alignment on a scale with a large number of steps, examination of the mudlib (/include/tune.h) suggests that this may be from -10000 (good) to 10000 (evil).

&lt;pre>#define MAX_AL 10000&lt;/pre>

The mapping in the mudlib (/std/living/living.c) of score align to absolute alignment values in the mud is as follows:

&lt;pre>string align_string() {
   switch ( alignment ) {
      case -MAX_AL .. -5001 : return "extremely good"; break;
      case -5000 .. -2501 : return "very good"; break;
      case -2500 .. -1251 : return "quite good"; break;
      case -1250 .. -601 : return "good"; break;
      case -600 .. -301 : return "barely good"; break;
      case -300 .. 300 : return "neutral"; break;
      case 301 .. 600 : return "barely evil"; break;
      case 601 .. 1250 : return "evil"; break;
      case 1251 .. 2500 : return "quite evil"; break;
      case 2501 .. 5000 : return "very evil"; break;
      default : return "extremely evil"; break;
   }
} /* align_string() */&lt;/pre>

Thus, if we divided those mudlib values by -200 (so evil is negative), then we get:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Min !!Max !!Align
|-
| 25.005 || 50 || extremely good
|-
| 12.505 || 25 || very good
|-
| 6.255 || 12.5 || quite good
|-
| 3.005 || 6.25 || good
|-
| 1.505 || 3 || barely good
|-
| -1.5 || 1.5 || neutral
|-
| -3 || -1.505 || barely evil
|-
| -6.25 || -3.005 || evil
|-
| -12.5 || -6.255 || quite evil
|-
| -25 || -12.505 || very evil
|-
| -50 || -25.005 || extremely evil
|}
This maps pretty well with reports from the [[Detect Alignment]] ritual.

==Changing alignment==
The most common way to change your alignment, either intentionally or unintentionally, is by killing things.
*In general, killing evil things makes you more good, killing good things makes you more evil, and killing neutral things moves you towards neutrality.
*Killing things with more extreme alignments moves you towards more extreme alignments, and works more quickly.
*See [[list of NPC Alignments]] for a handy list of common NPC alignments. 

There are, however, a few other ways:
*Ritually burying corpses: Priests can use their [[Burial commands|ritual bury]] command to move their alignment more towards their ideal.  This depends on [[faith.rituals.special]].
*[[Pray]]ing: Praying moves priests and followers towards ideal alignment.  Prayer is more effective when further away from the ideal, and is also more effective with more [[faith.rituals.special]].
*Shattering [[holy relic]]s
**If you're more evil than your deity's ideal, then you can shatter a relic of a deity more evil than yours to become more good.
**Likewise, if you're more good than your deity's ideal, you can shatter a relic of a deity more good than yours to become more evil.
**So, for example, a Pishite may shatter any non-Pishe relics to become more good (until going past ideal alignment) and a Sekkite may shatter any non-Sek relics to become more evil.
**A Gufnorkian would shatter Pishe relics to become less good, and relics of any other non-Gufnork deity to become more good.
**Witches (and presumably wizards) can also shatter relics to change alignment. It appears the relative goodness/evilness of the deity's ideal is compared to your current alignment, as you cannot worship a god.
**It appears the message "You can feel a chill within you as it breaks" indicates that you are at your max Good alignment from shattering relics.
**It appears the message "You can feel a sense of warmth within you as it breaks" indicates that your alignment has shifted towards Good.
*Using [[Sarilak]] (you need to already be a bit evil) will make your more evil while killing [[npcs]] than killing them without him.
*Burning things in the fire pit in [[Sek]]'s temple in [[Djelibeybi]] (northwest part of the main hall) has a small effect on alignment, appearing to make someone about 1/40 of a degree more evil per object.
**The syntax for this is &lt;code>burn &lt;object> in {pit|fire pit|firepit}&lt;/code>.
**It appears that all edible items may be burnt: this includes paper, most body parts, fluff, and food.
**It is possible to go significantly past ideal Sekkite alignment this way.
**Sacrificing hearts on Sek's altar in AM does ''not'' appear to change your alignment.
*Putting [[fluff]]s (from the ritual [[Summon Fluff]]) on [[Gufnork]]'s low altar either makes you more good (up to about 5 degrees good, it appears) or moves you towards Gufnork's ideal alignment. It also replenishes some of your [[health]]. This probably works for all fluffy things, not just fluffs.
*Performing [[Resurrect]] makes you more good, by about a degree.
*Certain quests change your alignment, though obviously this a one-time-only thing. For at least some of these, there are both good and evil options for completing the quest (which may not be mentioned on quest solution pages).
*If you're still in [[Pumpkin Town]], you can drown or rescue beetles in the priests' guild hut to make yourself up to about 25 degrees good or evil.

It appears relic alignment-shifting has limits for non-worshippers as well.  Shattering Hat and Sek relics as a witch did not raise the alignment above 24 good (very good).

==Determining alignment==
For yourself, you can get a fuzzy indicator of your alignment with your [[score]].  To see others' alignments, there are a variety of methods available.

===[[Detect Alignment]]===
Granted by [[Pishe]], [[Sek]], and [[Sandelfon]], as well as to Sandelfon's followers, this ritual gives you a numeric indication of the target's alignment and is the most precise method.  With lower skills, your result may be less accurate, but even then it seems to give you a result in the general area of the target's actual alignment.

===[[See Alignment]]===
Granted by [[Pishe]] and [[Sek]], this ritual changes your vision so that when you see someone, their fuzzy alignment (the same as is shown in "score align") and their deity, if applicable, is shown after their name.

===[[Light]]===
Performing Light on a target will cause them to glow in a colour that gives a general indication of their alignment.  Green is neutral, or nearly so.  The more towards the red end of the spectrum they glow (with crimson being the highest), the eviller they are, and the more towards the violet end of the spectrum they glow (with violet being the highest), the more good they are.

This ritual is [[Playerkilling|pk]]-checked, as it can interfere with [[covert]] actions.

===[[Red-hilted dagger]]===
Hitting someone with a red-hilted dagger will cause the dagger to spout flames--black flames for evil creatures, white flames for good, and nothing for neutral or nearly neutral creatures.  You can get, a "flicker", a "gout", or a "jet", with a flicker meaning 2 - 4 degrees, a gout meaning 5 - 15 degrees, and a jet meaning anything over 15.

==Titles==
There are two titles, Lord/Lady/Creature of Light/Darkness, given to the most "good" or most "evil" player online.

=== Content from Appraise ===

==Appraise &lt;item>==
When used on an item, it gives you this information:
*The material it's made out of
*Its colour
*Its length and width
*Whether you can wear it
*Whether it can be worn by a [[horse]]
*Whether it is [[armour]], if it can be worn
*Whether it is [[jewellery]]
*Whether you can hold it
*Whether it can be placed as [[furniture]]
*How much it can hold (both weight and number of items) if it's a container
*What type of [[weapon]] it is, if it's a weapon (but not the other information that [[judge]] gives)
*Its [[condition]]

You can generally only appraise an item if you are carrying it, but not wearing it.  The exception is [[furniture]], which you can also appraise if it's on the floor in the room you're in.

==Appraise here==
"Appraise here" will give you some information about the room you're in:
*The approximate [[temperature]] in the room
*The [[bright|light level]] in the room
*Whether you're inside or outside

=== Content from Armour ===

A piece of '''armour''' is a worn item which protects its wearer from a certain degree of physical damage.  

==Damage protection==

===Factors===
Various factors affect the degree of damage protection afforded by a piece of armour:
*Its [[condition]] - the better the condition, the higher protection it confers.{{research}}&lt;!-- Chat: This looks to be disabled in the mudlib - see research for details-->
*The quality of material it is made out of.  Higher quality materials (for example, klatchian steel) provide more protection than lower quality materials (for example, wood), although they also tend to be heavier.  Note that materials confer differing levels of protection against different attack types.  For example, chainmail provides good protection against sharp, slashing attacks, but is rather poor against piercing or bludgeoning attacks.
*The degree of [[enchantment]] of the armour - higher enchantment levels increase the protection provided.  Heavier armour can benefit more from enchantment than light armour can.

The [[vurdere]] command can be used to indicate a crude approximation of the degree of damage protection afforded by a piece of armour.

===Defensive ordering===
Armour is one of the last defensive layers to be applied.  Its effect on incoming damage is calculated ''after'' the following have been applied:
*[[Endorphin's Floating Friend]] and [[Grammer Scorbic's Household Guard]].
*[[Dodge]], [[parry]] and [[block]].
*[[Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator]], [[Sorklin's Field of Protection]] and [[Mama Kolydina's Instant Infestation]].
*[[Major Shield]] and [[Minor Shield]]

Armour's effect is applied ''before'' the following:
*[[Chrenedict's Corporeal Covering]]

==Coverage and layers==
Armour does not automatically protect a player from all attacks when worn - only the armour that is worn upon the part of the body that is hit has any effect.  Hence, gauntlets will only protect the hands, while a mail vest will protect the chest, but not the feet.  Many pieces of armour affect multiple areas of the body - for example, a [[Grflx scale]] protects the back, chest and arms.

Multiple pieces of armour can be worn over a particular body area, but only as long as their 'clothing layer' does not clash with anything else worn over that area.  For example, a chainmail coif and a steel helm can both be worn over the head simultaneously, whereas a close helm and a great helm cannot be worn together.  The name of an item do not always match the layer slot that it actually fits in - for example, a [[chainmail miniskirt]] actually fits in the suspender-belt slot since it conflicts with those items, not the miniskirt slot.  Also, some pieces of armour fit in multiple slots, such as the [[offler-headed mask]], which counts as both a helm and a mask.

You can see which areas a piece of armour protects by using the [[vurdere]] command on it.  Alternately, you can see which of all your armour is protecting which body areas by using the [[coverage]] command like so:
&lt;pre>
coverage armours except jewellery
&lt;/pre>
It is necessary to exclude jewellery because for some reason they are considered to be armour by the parser even though they do not have the protecting capacity of real armour.

====Clothing substitution====
However, since armour is very heavy, even with the lightest armour, which being made of leather gets to be extremely warming, it is possible to substitute some armour pieces for pieces of clothing for the purpose of testing layers.

==Condition and durability==
As armour absorbs damage, its condition degrades.  This makes it less effective in reducing damage and, in extreme cases, can cause the item to be destroyed if its condition falls to a low enough level.

The degree of damage to the armour itself is affected by:
*How much damage the armour absorbs from each attack - the more damage absorbed, the more the armour's condition degrades.
*The material the armour is made out of, and its weight - higher quality and heavier armour degrades slower.
*The degree of [[enchantment]] on the armour - more enchanted armour degrades slower.

Damage to armour can be fixed by repairing it in a [[smithy]], [[leatherworking shop]] or [[woodworking shop]] as appropriate to the material it is made out of.  The condition of armour is apparent by looking at it, or otherwise by using the command '[[condition]] &lt;armour(s)>'.

==Mechanics - damage absorption==
{{Mudlib caveat|scope=section|status=unconfirmed}}

The following stages are used to determine how much damage is absorbed by a piece of armour:

===Base armour class===
All armour has a base armour class versus the three damage types (blunt, sharp and pierce).  This is, very roughly, the amount of damage that the unaltered armour will absorb from each hit, without taking any other considerations into account.

This base armour class can be determined from the [[vurdere]] command as follows:

{|class="wikitable" border="1"
 !'''Order'''
 !'''Vurdere'''
 !'''Base AC'''
 !'''Average Base AC'''
 |-
 |1
 |Terrible
 |0 - 3
 |1.5
 |-
 |2
 |Amazingly poor
 |4 - 7
 |5.5
 |-
 |3
 |Pretty poor
 |8 - 11
 |9.5
 |-
 |4
 |Poor
 |12 - 15
 |13.5
 |-
 |5
 |OK
 |16 - 18
 |17
 |-
 |6
 |Average
 |19 - 22
 |20.5
 |-
 |7
 |Good
 |23 - 26
 |24.5
 |-
 |8
 |Very good
 |27 - 30
 |28.5
 |-
 |9
 |Extremely good
 |31 - 33
 |32
 |-
 |10
 |Excellent
 |34+
 |37?&lt;ref>We don't know the maximum vurdere value for excellent or even if there is a maximum, which makes figuring out the average rather difficult. The average displayed is extrapolated based on a maximum of 40, which makes the last step twice as large as the others.&lt;/ref>
 |}
&lt;references/>
It is unclear if there is a way to get more accurate AC than vurdere value.

===Enchantment===
[[Enchantment]] increases the armour class as follows:

{{Prebox|AC {{=}} Base-AC * (1 + enchantment/max-enchantment) + enchantment}}

Because the maximum enchantment is related to the weight of the item, this means that enchantment has a very significant effect for heavy armour, and a lesser effect for light armour.

To illustrate this, see the following table detailing the AC at various levels of enchantment for different weights, all for items that vurdere as 'Extremely good':

{|class="wikitable" border="1"
 !'''Weight (lb)'''
 !'''Maximum enchantment'''
 !'''Base AC'''
 !'''AC (4 steady but dull enchant)'''
 !'''AC (7 bright enchant)'''
 !'''AC (10 maximum enchant - radiant)'''
 |-
 |5 || 16 || 32 || 50 (6 thaums) || 65 (11 thaums) || 80 (16 thaums)
 |-
 |10 || 27 || 32 || 53 (10 thaums) || 71 (18 thaums) || 91 (27 thaums)
 |-
 |15 || 38 || 32 || 59 (15 thaums) || 79 (26 thaums) || 102 (38 thaums)
 |-
 |20 || 50 || 32 || 63 (19 thaums) || 87 (34 thaums) || 114 (50 thaums)
 |}
 
Note that a fully enchanted item will always more than double the base AC of the armour.

===Effect of strength of attack===
The degree of damage absorbed by armour decreases with stronger attacks (as they are more able to penetrate the armour), down to a minimum level of half the AC.

The specific formula is:

{{Prebox|Damage absorbed by armour (HP) {{=}} min(damage, max(AC / 2, AC - damage/10))}}

Where AC is the total AC of all pieces of armour in the location being hit.

Therefore:
*While damage is less than AC / 1.1, all damage is absorbed.
*While damage is less than AC * 5, AC - damage / 10 is absorbed.
*Past that, AC / 2 is absorbed.

Our fully-enchanted 20lb armour from the table above (AC: 114) absorbs damage as follows:

{|class="wikitable" border="1"
 !Damage of attack
 !Damage absorbed by armour
 !Damage let through
 !Absorption ratio

 |50

 |-
 |600+
 |57
 |543+
 |&lt; 10%
 |-
 |}

In summary:
*While the damage is 103 or less, all damage is absorbed by the armour.
*While the damage is 570 or less, 114 - damage / 10 is absorbed.
*Past 570, 57 is absorbed.

==Mechanics - Chance for armour to protect==
{{Mudlib caveat|scope=section|status=part-confirmed}}

Armour can of course only protect the wearer if it is hit.  The chance that an enemy will strike the body part protected by a given piece of armour is dependent on their [[Tactics#Focus|tactics-focus]].  If they are focusing on a given body part, then they will always hit armour covering that part when their attacks are successful.

For other focuses, the following table gives the chance that an attack will hit a given body area:

==Armour tables==
Nearly all the standard armours that can currently be obtained are in the armour tables in the wiki.

Many of the best custom armours are also entered.

We have tables of standard armours, custom armours and all, each available in various stages of enchantment.
*[[Standard armours]] shows armours available from shops and npc inventories.
**[[Standard armours/50]] shows armours enchanted as close to 50% as possible, which should not decay.
**[[Standard armours/65]] shows armours enchanted as close to 65% as possible, which should not decay for [[talisman]]s.
**[[Standard armours/100]] shows armours enchanted to the maximum the item will take, which will decay.
*[[Ug Ogg Armours]] shows custom armours available to order from [[Ug Ogg]] in [[Djelibeybi]].
**[[Ug Ogg Armours/50]] shows armours enchanted as close to 50% as possible, which should not decay.
**[[Ug Ogg Armours/65]] shows armours enchanted as close to 65% as possible, which should not decay for [[talisman]]s.
**[[Ug Ogg Armours/100]] shows armours enchanted to the maximum the item will take, which will decay.
*[[Armours]] shows all armours.
**[[Armours/50]] shows armours enchanted as close to 50% as possible, which should not decay.
**[[Armours/65]] shows armours enchanted as close to 65% as possible, which should not decay for [[talisman]]s.
**[[Armours/100]] shows armours enchanted to the maximum the item will take, which will decay.

Other sites also present a list of armour pieces with various information.

The sites thought to be newer/more up to date are higher. Your mileage may vary.

=== Content from Atlas ===
Atlases, or player maps, are simply maps of the game created by players or in the distant past for some [[terrains]] maps, creators. They are a priceless tool for navigation.

See [[Map (command)]] for the in-game command to see around you or [[Map (item)]] for the in-game maps that can be used to locate where you are from within the game.

=Maps=
The more up-to-date maps are the maps updated or created by [[User:Quow|Quow]] and put in the [https://quow.co.uk/minimap.php Quow's Cow Bar and Minimap plugin] are currently more up-to-date than any other maps. They are reproduced below.
