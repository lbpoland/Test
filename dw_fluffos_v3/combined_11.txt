=== Content from Mounts ===
'''Mounts''' are '''noble companions''' that can help you '''carry''' things, you can '''ride''' them and they can help to '''fight'''.

Currently the only mounts in the game are '''horses''', added on April 2, 2021. '''Camels''' are not yet in the game, but they are in the help files as mounts, so they should come in later, on Thursday.

'''Mount''' is also a [[command]] used to mount the various animal mounts.

For the wild animals, see [[Horse (Bestiary)]] and [[Camel (Bestiary)]].

For the skills, see [[Adventuring.movement.riding.horse]] and [[Adventuring.movement.riding.camel]].

The latest horse changes can be found here: {{Devblog|826}}, also archived [[Developer_Blogs#826_Horse_Changes.2C_posted_on_Wed_Apr_21_18:06:12_2021|here]].

The skillchecks for assessing and grooming horses are now affected by docility, like the others. If your horse has more than 60 docility, they will now be easier compared to before; if it has less, they will be harder.

Unlike priest [[minions]], horses do not drain [[XP]] when used in combat.

==How to obtain a mount==
*Horses can be purchased &amp; rented from [[Prinscilla]] at [https://dw.daftjunk.com/show.php?map=Ankh-Morpork&amp;points=737,101 the stable on King's Down] (northern Ankh-Morpork).
*You can only own one horse per character. You can sell your horse back to Prinscilla (at a much lower price eg. $75 for a healthy pony) and it will be immediately available for someone else to buy. 
*Default prices before haggling range between {{Dollars|A$300}} and {{Dollars|A$900}}.
*You can haggle &lt;code>syntax haggle&lt;/code> to lower the price when buying a horse, this involves a [[people.trading.buying]] skill check. After the price has been reduced, you can accept or reject the offer.
*You can name your horse. &lt;code>name my horse as Your Horse Name&lt;/code> Note the '''as''' bit.
**The name works with a space.
**If you're getting something like &lt;code>You cannot name a buckskin horse Buttercup.&lt;/code> it means you did not put the '''as''' before the name.
**For &lt;code>name already taken&lt;/code> there might already be a player with the same name.
**Anyone can see the name by looking at your horse.
**You cannot put two saddles on one horse.

*You can rent a horse. ''Syntax rent''. Haggle with Prinscilla (until she won't lower the price anymore). Mine has cost 22.18 dollars (from 30 dollars she first asked), with level 25 in people.trade.buying and selling. I've been able to have the horse with me for about a week and then the horse dropped everything he was wearing/carrying and went back to Prinscilla. (Sorry, we need better testing with this. I just wanted to add that at the moment -it might change- we can rent a horse, but after a week the possibilities of rerenting/buying are not clear right now. Work in progress).

==Mount handling==

Mounts can be used for riding, carrying equipment, and combat.

===Riding and leading===
To lead a mount, use &lt;code>lead &lt;my mount>&lt;/code> and your mount will follow you. This requires the relevant [[adventuring.movement.riding]] subskill.

To ride a horse, you must first mount it with the [[Mount (command)|Mount command]]. This can be learned from another player at 25 levels of [[adventuring.movement.riding]]. You can then move around like normal. You can also &lt;code>journey &lt;direction>&lt;/code>, which will automatically continue to journey in that direction every few seconds until you stop or it is no longer possible. This does not consume stamina.

Horses can also be ridden and led through magic &amp; divine portals, though they cannot remember routes that involve them. This consumes stamina.

There are many things you ''cannot'' do while mounted. Usually you can &lt;code>dismount&lt;/code>, do those things, then &lt;code>mount&lt;/code> again. However it is harder to mount while [[fighting]] in the same room. You cannot:

*[[Cast]] [[spells]]
*[[Perform]] [[rituals]]
*[[Backstab]]
*[[Steal]]
*[[Circle]]
*[[Fly]] on a [[broomstick]] (but when you fly your mount will gallop to your new location if it was following you)
*[[Berserk]]

Riding &amp; leading a horse requires adventuring [[Guild Points]].  If you run out, it becomes likely that you'll be thrown from the horse, or that it will stop following you. This can also happen even with full GP if your riding skill is too low.

You need to get off your horse to pass through doors.
*If you ride through a doorway (including portals) while mounted, you will be knocked off the horse and incur minor damage (85 HP). Head armour or magical shields can protect against the damage. 
*A riding skillcheck will then be performed to determine if you at least automatically start leading your horse.
*If you do not, you will silently leave your horse behind (though at least on the exit side of the door / portal).
*Note that if you have insufficient adventuring GP available, you will likely auto-fail the skillcheck.

You can follow along on a ride if both of you are mounted.

===Fast travelling===

Horses provide a fast travel system using the [[ride]] command, traversing routes between locations they have been taught at much faster speed than normal travel. Unlike magical &amp; divine methods of travel, they do actually traverse the intervening space and the trip can be interrupted mid-way (e.g. due to the horse running out of stamina). You can just 'continue' riding if you are interrupted.

Locations need to be taught by riding your horse between places they remember (you can remember the destination when getting there).
*You need to stay mounted while teaching a new route.
*It might fail if it's too long, so you can put a remembered place in between.
*With more intuition the horse can remember more locations and routes.
*Locations learned by horses are case insensitive.
*The list of locations in &lt;code>ask my horse to remember&lt;/code> is alphabetized.
*You can rename a learned location by redoing &lt;code>ask &lt;horse> to learn location &lt;location>&lt;/code> at the learnt location.

===Mounted combat===

Horses can fight both alongside and under their owners.  The [[charge]] and [[storm]] commands are combat special attacks that can only be performed while mounted. This consumes stamina.

Your horse's ability in combat seems directly tied to your [[fighting.special.mounted]] skill, even if you are not mounted.

===Carrying equipment===

Horses wearing saddlebags and pack saddles can carry equipment. &lt;code>Stash&lt;/code> and &lt;code>retrieve&lt;/code> are used for getting things in and out equipped packs on your horse, and uses [[ad.mo.ri.ho]] to do successfully. This can be done covertly using &lt;code>stash covert&lt;/code>, which also includes a [[covert.manipulation.passing]] skill check. These appear harder to do while mounted. Failure will result in being kicked, which does a moderate amount of damage (protected by TPA).

A horse wearing a pack saddle cannot be mounted and ridden.

===Summoning your mount===

Horses located in a different room can be summoned to the room you are in, either by playing a "cracked ocarina", or (after using the ocarina enough times), by simply &lt;code>shout&lt;/code> or &lt;code>lsay&lt;/code>ing the horse's name. The is checked against [[ad.mo.ri.ho]] and uses adventuring GP (confirmed by tm).

A mount can be summoned from most places, although a stabled mount cannot be summoned{{research}}.

===Dressing your mount===

Essential equipment (saddles, horseshoes, ever-stylish jodhpurs, etc.) can be purchased from the King's Down stable, in [https://dw.daftjunk.com/show.php?map=Ankh-Morpork&amp;points=763,228 the Ridings Bit Shop] on The Ridings (northern Ankh-Morpork). You can also dress your horse in [[horse armour]].

Dressing a horse uses [[crafts.husbandry.animal.grooming]] and [[adventuring.movement.riding.horse]]{{research}}, using the syntax &lt;code>put &lt;equipment> on &lt;mount>&lt;code> or &lt;code>dress &lt;mount> with &lt;equipment>&lt;/code>. You can only dress your own mount.

Mounting, stash and retrieve, dressing and undressing, and possibly lead all appear to be more difficult during combat{{research}}.

===Horse armour===
See: [[Horse Armours]]

==Upkeep==
You need to dress, feed, and groom horses to keep them healthy &amp; functional.  If you are careless or inattentive, you will also need to get their ailments treated regularly.

;Food
*Basic feed (hay &amp; oats) are available for purchase in the King’s Down stable.  Horses have also been known to eat other things, if offered them.
*Feeding hay raises +20% fibre for one handful of hay. If this raises fibre above 100%, nothing wrong seems to happen.
*Feeding oats raises +20% calories and +5% fibre for one handful of oats. If this raises calories above 100%, then it becomes overweight.
*Feeding [[sugar lumps]] (cubes) raise calories, about 10% for 20 lumps, but it inflicts the illness toothache after around 40 lumps.
*Feeding an [[apple]] raises fibre by 12% and calories by 3%. It also inflicts between 1% and 2% toothache. Lastly, it increases docility by +5 for about 500 seconds.
*Feeding a turnip raises fibre by 10% and calories by 5%.
*Feeding a [[carrot]] raises fibre by 2% and calories by 1%.
*Horses lose 46% fibre per hour at a constant rate. They do not lose calories unless they take actions that deplete stamina, like combat.

;Grooming
*Your mount needs to be groomed regularly to prevent skin lice.
*You need a grooming kit. Having the tools in component pouches does not work.
*The tools in the grooming kit lose condition as they are used. You can [[repair]] the brushes, [[fix]] the combs &amp; pick and [[sew]] the towel. Or just buy another one, they're cheap.
*Grooming your horses is easier with high docility and harder with low docility, especially below 60.
*Horses lose 7.5% cleanliness per hour at a constant rate.
*Grooming costs 50 gp, takes 2 minutes and 22 seconds, and must be fully completed in order to restore your mount's cleanliness. Stopping partway through results in no cleanliness increase.

;Illnesses
*See the [[#Illnesses]] section for details.
*Witches can [[treat]] most diseases using [[turpentine]]. Witches can fly to you as long as you're outside and not in [[no-fly zones]].
*There is a horsespital in the south corner of the King’s Down stable, where [[Doughnut Jimmy]] offers treatment for ill horses, except for Resurrection sickness.  Typically this costs {{Dollars|A$50}} to {{Dollars|A$60}}.
*Horses must be properly shoed, otherwise they will rapidly become injured (cracked hooves).
**Camels will not require shoes, per the help files, though there is currently no known way to rent or buy a camel mount.

;Hit points
*Horses have finite hit points, and just like players &amp; [[NPCs]] their current HP level can be evaluated using the [[Health (command)|health]] command.
*Horses may be healed using most normal means, such as rituals (e.g. [[Cure Light Wounds]]) and [[bandage|bandages]].

;Knowing what's wrong
Since you cannot really ascertain the status, needs, &amp; diseases of your horse until you can assess them successfully, it is recommended you do not buy a horse before developing substantial bonuses in the relevant skills:

*[[adventuring.movement.riding.horse]] at least a bonus of 190 (for very high docility horse), used to assess traits and to reliably lead your horse. 
*[[crafts.husbandry.animal.grooming]] to assess needs, no matter what uses your are looking for, at least a 150 bonus.
*[[crafts.medicine.diagnosis]] to assess health, strongly recommended in order to detect diseases early, to minimise expense and inconvenience. (150 bonus is fine to start)
*[[fighting.special.mounted]] to ride the mount into combat and increase your mount's fighting skills.

See the [[#Assess|Assess]] section for more details.

You can practice on any horses you find, such as those sold by [[Prinscilla]]. You can use assess on all mounts in the room (assess mounts).

Without sufficient skills, you're unlikely to be able to care for your horse.  It will become at first disobedient (walking off on its own, and refusing to follow you or let you ride it) and then ill, eventually leading to the death of the horse.  At the very least it will require frequent trips to the horsepital, at significant expense.

Note: horses emit room chats that '''seem''' like they might be conveying its needs, such as that their tummy rumbles or they poke around at you for food, but they can be difficult to interpret (and it’s not yet proven that these horse emotes are actually conveying the horse’s needs, it could for example be indicating that the environment of the horse is likely to increase some disease).

Stabling a horse will slowly restore their fibre and calories at a rate of about 35% per hour. It will pause and NOT restore their cleanliness. Stabling costs $1 per hour logged on.

==Needs==
To be healthy, a horse needs certain things. You can see most of those things with &lt;code>assess &lt;mount> needs&lt;/code>.
*Burden: Must not be too high from stuff on the horse.
*Fibre: Feed hay, but not too much or it could become sick.
*Calories: Feed oats, but not too much or it could become sick.
*Cleanliness: Groom the horse to keep this up.
*Stamina: Regenerates over time. (sickness probably reduces this)

==Illnesses==
Illnesses reduce the traits of the mount until it is treated.
*This often reduces docility, doing anything to the horse including treat becomes harder.

Most diseases can be treated by [[Treat]] or the horse doctor at the Horsepital in the stable on King's Down, [[Ankh-Morpork]].

See the notes below the table for more information.

|}

Broken legs:
*Doesn't show in assess health, it's visible as a line in the long description: &lt;code>He has broken his left and right legs.&lt;/code>

Toothache:
*Feeding an [[apple]] gave 1% toothache, feeding another apple put it at 3%, but after a couple of minutes it went away on its own.

Pneumonia:
*After riding, it is important to rub your mount dry with a towel so that it does not get pneumonia. (from mount riding help file)
*There's a big towel sold at the stables to dry horses.
*The rate at which pneumonia progresses has been tweaked. (from horse changes)
*Horses will now be dried off by the blessing of Fish after passing through His passage room. Additionally, they will not get pneumonia until they leave the water. (from horse changes)

Resurrection sickness:
*The horse recovers progressively very slowly over time.
*It took between ~2.5 and 3 hours to be fully cured but improvement is gradual.
*[[Pale horse's balm]] has to be purchased from the [[T-shop]], which means it is very difficult or very expensive to obtain.

==Death==
Unfortunately mounts can meet the grim Reaper.

When you're not in the same room, you'll see:

  The ghost of a bay horse drifts in mournfully.

Ghost horses will still follow you around until you get them into more corporeal form.
*Find corpse cannot be perfomed on horses
*You can get your horse raised in a stable.
*You can also ask a priest to perform one of [[Raise dead]] or [[Resurrect]] rituals on the ghost horse.
*After returning to life it will have '''Resurrection sickness'''. If the horse was returned using [[Raise dead]] or a stable, the sickness will result in -9 to all stat points. If the horse was returned using [[Resurrect]], then the sickness will only result in -4 to all stat points.
*The [[Raise Dead Pet]] ritual does not work on the ghost nor on the player for mounts.

Otherwise you can try to sell your dead mount, but that's unlikely to give you much money in return.
*Dead horses will now be taken by Death immediately after being sold, to prevent shenanigans.

==Traits==
There are five traits:

*'''Vitality''' determines the stamina of the horse.  Stamina is consumed during fast travel, regular travel while burdened, and combat - if it runs out, the horse may stop mid-travel, or be less effective in combat.
**Stamina is ''not'' consumed during unburdened regular room-by-room travel (including journeying in terrain using “journey &lt;direction>”).
*'''Docility''' determines how easy the horse is to use (i.e. adjusts the skillchecks up or down).
**At least one player has reported that docility lowered and another trait increased while doing things with a horse. This made doing everything harder and the player could no longer ride their horse.
**You can visit a stable to 'retro' your mount to be more docile, adding to docility and reducing another trait, or less docile, reducing docility and increasing another trait.
*'''Speed''' determines how much the horse can carry, how quickly it travels, and how far it can travel before becoming exhausted (in concert with vitality - faster horses cover more distance per unit of stamina).
*'''Strength''' determines the horse’s effectiveness in combat (in combination with your [[fighting.special.mounted]]), and how much it can carry.
*'''Intuition''' determines how many routes &amp; places the horse can remember, and how engaged it can be in combat (from weakly fighting beside you at low intuition, to being a powerful warhorse upon which you trample your enemies, at high intuition).
**A riding skillcheck opposed by the (inverse of the) horse's intuition is required to engage the horse in combat (and perform specials like [[charge]] and [[storm]]).
**Riding in combat confers a "significant height advantage" over foes, according to &lt;code>help mount fighting&lt;/code>. Attacks tend to be aimed at opponents' upper bodies, such as their chest, arms, and head. It's unknown if there are additional benefits to this height advantage{{research}}.
**At 60 intuition and above, the rider will get slightly increased attack speed, and both rider and mount will get a chance to avoid some attacks
**:&lt;pre>The scruffy shopper kicks out at you but the attack goes wide due to the blood bay horse's movements.&lt;/pre>
**:&lt;pre>The flustered civil servant kicks out at the blood bay horse but the attack goes wide due to the blood bay horse's movements.&lt;/pre>
**At 80(? seen at 81) intuition and above, the mount will sometimes perform a charge attack of its own, knocking the victim to the floor, and possibly going on to trample them too.
**:&lt;pre>The liver chestnut horse charges at the tricky monk, knocking him to the ground with a lash of her hooves.&lt;/pre>
**:&lt;pre>Before the tricky monk can get up, the liver chestnut horse tramples over him with her hooves.&lt;/pre>
**Any ailments of the horse - including simply exhaustion (low stamina) - reduce its effective intuition, potentially making the horse unexpectedly unwilling to fight.
**Horses roll to trample opponents every round.
**If your horse is attacked and set to assist you, you will assist your horse automatically (regardless of its intuition).

Thus while vitality &amp; docility apply universally, only two of the other three matter for each of the horse’s three uses:

*Speed and strength are important for carrying.
*Speed and intuition are important for riding / fast travel.
*Strength and intuition are important for combat.

===Adjusting traits===

Horses’ traits change only through use, or (in a limited fashion) through using &lt;code>retro&lt;/code> command at a stable.
*For a change through exercise to occur the horse needs to have exercised enough, for example fought a couple of opponents, this is indicated when you see ++ and -- with accurate &lt;code>assess traits&lt;/code>.
*Trait change through exercise seems to only happen a [[roundworld]] hour of playing after the last change.

Horses have a fixed amount of points to spread amongst the five traits (similar to the 65 point system for player [[stats]]).
*Increasing one trait requires taking points from another trait.  Thus if you e.g. take a horse bred for riding, and use it instead mostly in combat, it will over time increase its strength trait at expense of its speed trait (potentially among others) until reaching the trait limit for the breed.
*The less expensive, high docility horse breeds have '''220 trait points'''.
*The more expensive, decent docility horse breeds have '''230 trait points'''.

&lt;pre>The dapple grey horse puffs a breath out of her nose and gazes at you.  Somehow, you can tell that she has more strength and less intuition now.&lt;/pre>

Using &lt;code>retro&lt;/code> at a stable can adjust only the horse's docility trait directly, lowering it - and thus adding a point into one of the other four traits - or increasing it (by reducing one of the other four traits).  Consequently, your riding skill is crucial in determining the ultimate capabilities of your horse, as a higher riding skill allows you to work with less docile horses, freeing up trait points from docility to be spent elsewhere.

Each use of the &lt;code>retro&lt;/code> command at a stable moves 1-5{{research}} trait points, and costs {{Dollars|A$0.50}}.  It results in a concussion to the horse (or, if the horse is already concussed, increases the severity by approximately 13 percentage points - repeated concussions may cause the horse to turn ghostly).  Horsepitals &amp; witches can treat concussions.

*Furthermore, you can only retro a limited amount of docility into the other traits. The breeds that naturally have high docility cannot have it lowered as low as horses that naturally have decent docility.
*There are no known stat modifiers for horses.  [[Bless]], for example, gives the appearance of succeeding but has no actual effect.

===Temporary trait effects===
There are temporarily changes to horse traits that apply bonuses or penalties, similar to [[stat effects]] for other characters.

Traits are (temporarily) reduced while a horse is sick.  The most obvious manifestation of this is increased difficulty getting the horse to do what you want (i.e. reduced docility).

Feeding an [[apple]] to a horse increases its docility by 5 for about 500 seconds (8 minutes, 20 seconds).

Using [[warpaint]] on a horse increases its intuition and strength by 5.

==Breeds==
The following table uses the information from the breed that can be seen by looking at the mount.

By default, the table is sorted by putting at the top the breeds with higher docility, then the breeds with more poor skills, then those with less poor skills.

While there are only three trait categories shown connected to each breed when looking at horses, the traits actually have numeric values that are much more detailed.
*The mount fighting help file refers to the levels: basic, low, moderate and high, but those do not seem to correspond to the look breed levels. It does fit to vague assess values, with basic = very low.

==Trait limits==
The breed's known trait categories are used for more than the starting traits. There are limits to which you can modify each trait according to the breed trait category.

There limits prevent you from changing docility with &lt;code>retro&lt;/code> as well as trait changes due to doing activities with your mount.

The high docility breeds are called '''ponies'''. They have a total of '''220''' trait points. Their trait limits are:
*{{fontcolor|green|High}} - stay within a minimum of 60 and a maximum of 100.
*{{fontcolor|blue|Decent}} - stay within a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 70.
*{{fontcolor|red|Poor}} - stay within a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 40. 

The decent docility breeds are called '''horses''', '''pullers''' or '''chargers'''. They have a total of '''230''' trait points. Their trait limits are:
*{{fontcolor|green|High}} - stay above or at a minimum of 62 and a maximum of 100.
*{{fontcolor|blue|Decent}} - stay within a minimum of 32 and a maximum of 72.
*{{fontcolor|red|Poor}} - stay within a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 42. 

Once a trait is at its minimum, it will not schedule a change to lower it. Same thing for a trait at its maximum, it will not schedule a change to increase it.

----
Theoretical example Morporkian puller (decent docility - 230 trait points):
&lt;pre>
This brindle mare's copper brown coat has faint yellow stripe-like markings across her body and legs.  She is of the Morporkian puller breed, which is known for high speed, decent vitality and docility and poor intuition and strength.
&lt;/pre>

It has the following starting traits, which are within 1/3 of the 0-100 range, according to the categories of its traits.
&lt;pre>
The brindle horse (Morporkian puller):
  Vitality .................. 54 (decent)
  Speed ..................... 78 (high)
  Intuition ................. 21 (poor)
  Strength .................. 19 (poor)
  Docility .................. 58 (decent)
&lt;/pre>

It also has maximum and minimum based on its known trait categories.
*Vitality (decent) stays within a minimum of 32 and a maximum of 72.
*Speed (high) stays above or at a minimum of 62.
*Intuition (poor) stays within a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 42. 
*Strength (poor) stays within a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 42. 
*Docility (decent) stays within a minimum of 32 and a maximum of 72.

If you retro the Morporkian puller's docility to 52 and do lots of combat, then it will eventually reach this state:
&lt;pre>
The brindle horse:
  Vitality .................. 32 (decent - at minimim)
  Speed ..................... 62 (high - at minimum)
  Intuition ................. 42 (poor - at maximum)
  Strength .................. 42 (poor - at maximum)
  Docility .................. 52 (decent)
&lt;/pre>
*If you retro the horse to have higher docility, then the points for it will be taken from the traits that are not at their minimum.
*Conversely, if you retro the horse to have lower docility, then some of the traits that are not at their maximum will increase.
----
Another (real this time) example with a Bad Ass horse (decent docility - 230 trait points):
&lt;pre>
Frazyl's Hon the bay dun gelding's coat is a creamy tan all over with a black mane and tail and faint black striped markings on its legs.  It is of the Bad Ass horse breed, which is known for decent vitality, speed, intuition and docility and poor strength.

Frazyl's Hon the bay dun horse (Bad Ass horse):
  Vitality .................. 32 (decent - at minimum)
  Speed ..................... 32 (decent - at minimum)
  Intuition ................. 72 (decent - at maximum)
  Strength .................. 31 (poor, near maximum)
  Docility .................. 63 (decent)
&lt;/pre>
*Even when doing mounted combat, strength does not increase, even though it is not yet at the maximum, because vitality and speed are at their minimum, docility does not decrease when performing activities [*] and intuition is also used in combat, so it does not decrease. To increaes strength further one would have to lower docility to have more points available or lower intuition.
*Even when using the horse ball intuition does not increase, even when vitality and speed were higher, because it is already at the maximum.

[*] There was a report that docility did lower when doing activities. It might have been a bug. Cannot reproduce.

==Appearance Colour==

The types of horses are mare (her), gelding (it/its) and stallion (him/his).

==Assess==
GP cost: 25 gp.
*Each additional target uses 25 gp.
*The type of gp used is the same as the skill, crafts gp for needs &amp; health, adventuring gp for traits.
*If you are out of GP, then you can still get good results if you have enough skill to always succeed for that type of assess.
*Assess is easier with high docility and harder with low docility, especially below 60.
*Sick horses have lower traits, lower docility makes assessing them harder.
*All the tiers of assess moved result down by one rank - if you could get a vague result before, you will be able to get a semi-vague result now, and if you could get a semi-vague result you will now get an accurate one. It is now impossible to get the unknown result, regardless of how ferocious your horse is.

The numbers in parenthesis show the temporary modifiers that are in effect, usually from diseases (in the above example, a mild concussion from recently being retro'd).
*This is similar to how &lt;code>[[score]] stats&lt;/code> show temporary modifiers for player stats.
*In the above example, vitality is going to be 40 when the concussion is treated.
*In the example the -- indicates that the next stat change will include a decrease from speed and the ++ an increase for strength. (This '''can change''' via exercise before the stat change occurs.)

Name
     horse dealer / camel dealer - the place to buy and sell horses or camels   

Syntax
     buy &lt;mount> from &lt;dealer>                                                  
     sell &lt;mount> to &lt;dealer>                                                   
     rent &lt;mount> from &lt;dealer>                                                 
     return &lt;mount> to &lt;dealer>                                                 
     haggle with &lt;dealer>                                                       
     accept offer from &lt;dealer>                                                 
     reject offer from &lt;dealer>                                                 

Description
     You can buy a mount from a horse dealer or a camel dealer, depending  
     on whether you want a horse or a camel as your mount.  To begin a     
     purchase, choose a suitable mount from the herd following the dealer  
     around and try to buy it from the dealer.                             
                                                                           
     Naturally, haggling is a vital part of the mount purchasing process.  
     The better you are at judging mounts and at trading, the more         
     effective you will be at haggling.                                    
                                                                           
     You can sell mounts back to the dealer if you don't want them any     
     more.  Note that dead horses do not tend to fetch a very high price.  
                                                                           
     You can also rent mounts, if you don't feel like committing to a      
     purchase.  Rented mounts will stay with you for one week, after which 
     they will return to the dealer, or you can return them to the dealer  
     early if you don't want them any more.                                

Example
     A grey horse, two blue roan horses, a chestnut horse, a rose grey horse and
     Prinscilla are standing here.                                               
     Prinscilla says with a Lancrastian accent: You tired of kicking up dust?    
     I've got the best horses around.                                           
     >buy blue roan horse 2 from prinscilla                                      
     Prinscilla exclaims to you with a Lancrastian accent: It's in amazing       
     health!  Just look at those teeth, they're perfect!                        
     Prinscilla says to you with a Lancrastian accent: I'll accept no less than  
     DjToon 30.00 for it.                                                       
     >haggle with prinscilla                                                     
     You exclaim to Prinscilla: It's in no condition to ride.  It's so fat, I    
     could roll it instead of ride it!                                          
     Prinscilla exclaims to you with a Lancrastian accent: You couldn't buy a    
     rocking horse for that much!                                               
     Prinscilla says to you with a Lancrastian accent: I'll accept no less than  
     DjToon 20.91 for it.                                                       
     >accept offer from prinscilla                                               
     Prinscilla says to you with a Lancrastian accent: You need DjToon 20.91 to  
     buy the blue roan horse and you don't have enough.                         
     >reject offer from prinscilla                                               
     Prinscilla says to you with a Lancrastian accent: Very well, then.

Name

Description
     Horses and camels are wonderful friends that can help out in lots of  
     ways, for the low price of food and care.  You can use them for       
     carrying things, riding, and helping you to fight.                    
                                                                           
     Mounts have five traits - vitality, speed, intuition, strength and    
     docility.  Vitality affects how much stamina your mount has and how   
     quickly it recovers, docility affects the amount of riding skill      
     required to get your mount to obey you, and the other three traits    
     help with carrying, riding, and fighting in various ways - speed and  
     strength for carrying, speed and intuition for riding, and strength   
     and intuition for fighting.  More details are available in the other  
     helpfiles in See Also.                                                
                                                                           
     Different breeds of mount have different base values in each trait to 
     begin with.  As you use a mount over time, it will also gain and lose 
     points in its traits depending on how much it's been exercising them -
     except for docility, which can only be adjusted by a stable's         
     retrophrenologist.  Assessing your mount's traits uses                
     adventuring.movement.riding.horse or                                  
     adventuring.movement.riding.camel, depending on the type of mount.    
                                                                           
     Mounts have nutritional needs - they need a certain amount of fibre   
     over time, and calories when they've been using stamina.  Some foods  
     are better at restoring fibre and some foods are better at restoring  
     calories.  Don't overfeed your mount, though, or it may become        
     overweight.  Assessing your mount's needs uses                        
     crafts.husbandry.animal.grooming.                                     
                                                                           
     In addition, your mount will become dirty over time and have to be    
     groomed.  You can purchase a grooming kit at most stables.            
                                                                           
     Horses, but not camels, also have to wear horseshoes to protect their 
     hooves.  You can change your horse's horseshoes at a smithy.          
                                                                           
     Mistreating your mount can result in an exciting variety of illnesses.
     You can get it treated either at a horse doctor, or by a player witch.
     Being sick will temporarily reduce your mount's trait values and may  
     kill it if it gets too ill.  Assessing your mount's health uses       
     crafts.medicine.diagnosis.                                            
                                                                           
     If your mount dies, it can be brought back to life with the Raise Dead
     or Resurrect rituals.

mount fighting                Discworld player help                        mount


Name
     mount - a warlike steed                                                    

Syntax
     ask &lt;mount> to assist in combat                                            
     ask &lt;mount> to not assist in combat                                        

Description
     Your mount can help you to fight in several ways:                     
                                                                           
     With a basic level of intuition, it will be able to assist you in     
     combat, fighting at your side.                                        
                                                                           
     With a low level of intuition, you will be able to mount it into      
     battle, gaining a significant height advantage over your foes.  This  
     also lets you use the charge and storm specials if you have them.     
                                                                           
     With a moderate level of intuition, you will be able to ride it       
     actively in battle, improving the speed of your attacks and causing   
     enemies' attacks to sometimes miss.                                   
                                                                           
     Finally, with a high level of intuition, your mount will learn how to 
     trample over enemies, greatly increasing its damage potential.        
                                                                           
     Your mount's strength and your fighting.special.mounted skill will    
     affect its combat skills, making it more effective and less likely to 
     die in a fight.  Fighting will consume your mount's stamina.  Wearing 
     an appropriate saddle will slightly reduce stamina consumption from   
     fighting.

Description
     Your mount can be used to rapidly travel from place to place; however,
     it is not magical and has to travel in a regular fashion across the   
     ground to get there.  It is also not omniscient, so you will have to  
     teach it the route from one location to another before it can take you
     between them.                                                         
                                                                           
     To teach your the route a route, start at a location that it knows,   
     ask it to start learning a route, and travel while mounted on it to   
     another location.  The other location does not have to be learned     
     ahead of time - you can ask your mount to learn a new location while  
     it's learning a route, and it will end the route at that place.  Note 
     that taking arcane transportation will confuse your mount and cancel  
     the route learning.                                                   
                                                                           
     Once you have a route between two locations, you can travel between   
     those two locations quickly by riding your mount.  Your mount can     
     travel along as many routes as required to get to faraway locations - 
     for example, if you have a route from Ephebe to Djelibeybi and another
     route from the same room in Djelibeybi to the Lower Djel Trading Post,
     you can ride directly to the Post from Ephebe.                        
                                                                           
     Riding will consume your mount's stamina.  The higher its speed, the  
     faster it will get to your destination and the less stamina it will   
     consume.  The higher its intuition, the more locations and routes it  
     will be able to remember.  Wearing an appropriate saddle will also    
     slightly reduce stamina consumption from riding.                      
                                                                           
     After riding, it is important to rub your mount dry with a towel so   
     that it does not get pneumonia.                                       
                                                                           
     If your trip is interrupted, whether through the use of the 'stop     
     riding' command, from being attacked, or from falling off your horse, 
     you can continue riding from where you left off.                      
                                                                           
     You can also journey through terrain using your mount.  This is like  
     normal journeying, but is automatic - your mount will continue until  
     you decide to stop.  This does not consume stamina.                   

Example
     >ask my horse to learn a route                                             
     The skewbald horse needs to have learned this location first in order to   
     start learning a route here.                                               
     >ask my horse to learn location stable 1                                   
     The skewbald horse looks around carefully, committing this place to memory.
     >ask my horse to learn a route                                             
     You need to be mounted on the skewbald horse to teach it a route.          
     >mount my horse                                                            
     The skewbald horse is not wearing a saddle.                                
     >buy lancrastian saddle                                                    
     You buy the Lancrastian saddle.                                            
     >get saddle                                                                
     You get a Lancrastian saddle from a muddy stable.                          
     >dress my horse with saddle                                                
     You dress the skewbald horse with the Lancrastian saddle.                  
     >mount my horse                                                            
     You mount the skewbald horse.                                              
     >ask my horse to learn a route                                             
     The skewbald horse starts watching its surroundings closely.               
     >south                                                                     
     You open the south door.                                                   
     Hp: 6025 (6110) Gp: 500 (500) Xp: 1114681                                  
     As you ride the skewbald horse through the door, you strike your head hard 
     on the doorframe and are sent tumbling out of the saddle.                  
     The skewbald horse, seeing you dismount, decides not to learn a route after
     all.

mount carrying                Discworld player help                        mount


Name
     mount - a bearer of burdens                                                

Syntax
     stash &lt;object> {in{{!}}on{{!}}into} &lt;mount> [saddlebags]                           
     retrieve &lt;object> from &lt;mount> [saddlebags]

     ask &lt;mount> to not accept things from strangers                            

Description
     Your mount can be dressed with saddlebags, which will allow it to     
     carry a few things for you - about a backpack's worth.  You can use   
     this to carry the food and various other necessities of mount-owning, 
     with a little space to spare.                                         
                                                                           
     If this is not enough space for you, your mount can be dressed with a 
     pack saddle as well, allowing it to carry as many items as you wish to
     fit on it.  This comes at the expense of using any other saddle,      
     however, which means you will be unable to mount it.                  
                                                                           
     When your mount is burdened, it will take an increasing amount of     
     stamina to move the higher its burden is.  The more speed and strength
     your mount has, the less it will be burdened by the same weight.      

Example
     >dress my horse with pack saddle                                           
     You dress the skewbald horse with the pack saddle.                         
     >get shields                                                               
     You get three large metal shields from a muddy stable.                     
     >give shields to my horse                                                  
     The skewbald horse is only mildly discomforted by the additional weight.   
     You strap three large metal shields onto the skewbald horse's pack saddle. 
     >ask my horse to return pack saddle                                        
     You remove a pack saddle from the skewbald horse.                          
     The skewbald horse drops three large metal shields.

Syntax
     treat &lt;mount>                                                              

Description
     When your mount gets sick, you can get it treated at a horse doctor or
     camel doctor.  Conveniently, most horse doctors are also well-versed  
     in camels and vice versa, allowing you to get treatment on the go.    
                                                                           
     Note that some witches can also treat mounts, which is likely to be   
     cheaper.                                                              

Example
     >treat my horse                                                            
     It will cost A$50 to treat your skewbald horse.  Do you wish to continue?  
     (y/n)

     You pay Quiet Eva A$50 to treat the skewbald horse.                        
     Quiet Eva inspects the skewbald horse carefully, paying attention to its   
     hooves and coat.                                                           
     Quiet Eva fusses over a sick horse.                                        
     Quiet Eva walks the skewbald horse around slowly, observing its gait for   
     problems.                                                                  
     Quiet Eva opens the skewbald horse's mouth to check its teeth.             
     Quiet Eva mixes some horse medicine into a bowl of mash and feeds it to the
     skewbald horse.                                                            
     After a few minutes, the skewbald horse starts to look better.

Description
     When you're done riding your mount, you can put it away in a stable   
     where it will be cared for by the finest of stablehands.              
                                                                           
     Mounts in stables will be fed and cleaned automatically.  Any         
     illnesses that naturally lessen over time will also lessen while      
     they're stabled.  However, the fee to destable your mount is higher   
     the longer it's been stabled.  Be careful not to stable your mount for
     too long, or your mount will be repossessed to pay off your debt!     
                                                                           
     You can destable your mount at a different stable from the one you    
     stabled it in - a stablehand will bring your mount over.              
                                                                           
     Some stables also contain a shop counter that sells supplies.         
                                                                           
     Stables also offer retrophrenologist services - at a stable, you can  
     adjust the docility of your mount, adding or removing points from its 
     other traits in exchange.  Naturally, this will give it a concussion, 
     which may require treatment.                                          
                                                                           
     If your mount dies, you can get its ghost raised from the dead at a   
     stable.  Note that this will cause more severe resurrection sickness  
     than getting it a Resurrect from a priest.                            

Example
     >stable my horse                                                           
     You hand the skewbald horse over to the stablehands.                       
     >check horse                                                               
     You have a quick look at the stabled horses and see that your skewbald     
     gelding seems to be doing well.                                            
     >destable my horse                                                         
     You pay the stablehands A$1.66 and they bring a skewbald horse out of the  
     stalls for you.
