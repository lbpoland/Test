'''Charge''' is a [[:Category:Fighting commands|fighting command]] which can be used while [[mounted]] to perform an attack on an opponent together with your [[mount]].

You must not already be in combat. If already in combat, use [[storm]].

==Acquisition==
Charge can be learned at 20 levels of [[fighting.special.mounted]] from a guild instructor or from another player who has the command.

==Syntax==
&lt;pre>charge &lt;living> at a {walk|trot|canter|gallop} with &lt;weapon>
charge &lt;living> at a {walk|trot|canter|gallop}&lt;/pre>

==Example==
&lt;pre>You prepare to shout "EAT THIS!" upon joining combat.
You hunch down over the liver chestnut horse and spur her into a walk at the haggling Hong salesman.
You charge straight into the haggling Hong salesman, putting all your weight into the blow.
You shout: EAT THIS!
The haggling Hong salesman is rocked by the bloodcurdling warcry.
You launch a powerful attack.  You chop up the protective Hong bodyguard's head with your axe that marks the spot as she leaps in at the last moment to protect the haggling Hong salesman.
The liver chestnut horse launches a powerful attack.  The liver chestnut horse crushes her hoof into the protective Hong bodyguard's right leg as the protective Hong bodyguard leaps in at the last moment to protect the haggling Hong salesman.&lt;/pre>

==Balancing Skill Check==
Not mentioned in the help file but if you are seeing "You lose your precarious attachment to &lt;horsename> the &lt;colour> horse and go flying.", then you may need some ad.ac.balancing skill. Seems to be a low requirement.

Name
     charge - run down someone on your horse

     charge &lt;living> at a {walk{{!}}trot{{!}}canter{{!}}gallop}                             

Description
     This command allows you to perform an attack on an opponent together  
     with your horse.  Your horse must have at least 40 intuition, you must
     be mounted on it, and you must not already be in combat.              
                                                                           
     Your ability in fighting.special.mounted determines your ability to   
     prepare the attack, and your weapon skill determines the efficacy of  
     your attack.  It will cost you 35 fighting guild points to attempt to 
     charge.                                                               
                                                                           
     The faster you charge, the more difficult it is to prepare the attack 
     but the more powerful it will be.

===Casting messages===
'''Casting'''

With latex powder:
&lt;pre>You prepare to cast Chrenedict's Corporeal Covering on yourself.
You rub sap on yourself to prime your skin.  It tingles.
You spread latex powder all over your skin while considering its elastic nature.
You rub varnish on yourself, to bind it all together.  It feels strangely cold.
&lt;/pre>
With chalk powder:
&lt;pre>You prepare to cast Chrenedict's Corporeal Covering on yourself.
You rub sap on yourself to prime your skin.  It tingles.
You rub chalk powder on your skin while considering its stone-like nature.
You rub varnish on yourself, to bind it all together.  It feels strangely cold.
&lt;/pre>
With metal filings:
&lt;pre>You prepare to cast Chrenedict's Corporeal Covering on yourself.
You rub sap on yourself to prime your skin.  It tingles.
You scatter metal filings in a net-like pattern across your skin while considering their armour-like nature.
You rub varnish on yourself, to bind it all together.  It feels strangely cold.
&lt;/pre>

'''Success'''

With latex powder:
&lt;pre>
1st cast: You feel your skin become elastic as rubber.
adding: Your skin feels a fair bit more elastic now.
maxed: Your skin is now as elastic as it can get.
&lt;/pre>
With chalk powder:
&lt;pre>1st cast: You feel your skin become rock hard.
adding: Your skin feels a fair bit harder now.
maxed: Your skin is now as hard as it can get.
&lt;/pre>
With metal filings:
&lt;pre>1st cast: You feel your skin tingle as the metal powder fuses together into thin metal bands, forming a net-like shape.
adding: The metallic network on your skin feels a tiny bit stronger now.
adding: The metallic network on your skin feels a fair bit stronger now.
adding: The metallic network on your skin feels much stronger now.
maxed: Your skin is now as thickly covered as it can get.
&lt;/pre>

If you had a different version of the spell on yourself, it will be removed:
&lt;pre>With a brief flash of magic, your [elastic|metallic|stony] skin falls away.
&lt;/pre>
The old version of CCC is also removed by casting this spell:
&lt;pre>Your skin feels itchy; large pieces flake off as you scratch it.&lt;/pre>

'''Failure'''
&lt;pre>You need a bath!
&lt;/pre>

Another failure can happen due to a bug if you have more than 50 pinches (exactly one handful) and less than 100 pinches of powder in the inventory:
&lt;pre>
Oh no, you seem to have mislaid a handful of skin-modifying agent!
&lt;/pre>


'''What the target sees'''
&lt;pre>
Geryon Womblesworth rubs some sticky gunk on you.  It tingles.
Geryon Womblesworth rubs some powdered chalk on your skin.
Geryon Womblesworth rubs varnish of some kind on you.  It feels strangely cold.
&lt;/pre>

First cast adds
&lt;pre>
You feel your skin become rock hard.
&lt;/pre>

Second cast (unless it's the last one) adds
&lt;pre>
Your skin feels much harder now.
&lt;/pre>

Last cast adds
&lt;pre>
Your skin is now as hard as it can get.
&lt;/pre>

'''What others see'''
&lt;pre>
Geryon Womblesworth rubs some sticky gunk on JiJi Daluka.
Geryon Womblesworth rubs some powdered chalk on JiJi Daluka's skin.
Geryon Womblesworth rubs varnish of some kind on JiJi Daluka.
&lt;/pre>

==Effects==
If you have the correct type of skin for the type of incoming damage, each hit received will be reduced either in part or in full, unless hit on the one body-part that is always left uncovered, in which case you will still receive full damage.

Blunt type damage is protected by Latex and Metal.

Sharp/Slash type damage is protected by Chalk and Metal.

Pierce type damage is protected by Chalk and Latex.

A random part of your body will always be left entirely unprotected, and this body part will change after the CCC takes so many hits, so a determined enemy can "focus" on your unprotected body part, or use a weapon doing a type of damage that your CCC cannot protect from.

===Layer Counts===
How many layers of protection you have can be determined by either look/peeking at a person and seeing the line of text in their description, or in "shields" or "group shields".  From most layers to least layers, the texts are as follows:

With chalk:
&lt;pre>
{His/Her/Your} skin has been hardened to a rock-like form, although it seems weaker around the chest.
... skin has been hardened with numerous layers of a mineral-like substance, although it seems weaker around the head.
... skin has been hardened with a chalk-like substance, although it seems weaker around the head.
... skin has been covered with several layers of a chalk-like substance, although the face seems not to be covered.
... skin has been covered with a thin layer of chalk, although the stomach seems not to be covered.
&lt;/pre>
With latex:
&lt;pre>
{His/Her/Your} skin has solidified into a rubberous form, although it seems weaker around the face.
... skin is made elastic with numerous layers of a rubber-like substance, although it seems weaker around the head.
... skin has been treated with a latex-like substance, although it seems weaker around the head.
... skin has been covered with several layers of a latex-like substance, although the stomach seems not to be covered.
... skin has been covered with a thin layer of latex, although the face seems not to be covered.
&lt;/pre>
With metal:
&lt;pre>
{His/Her/Your} skin is covered with a thick metal net, although it seems weaker around the chest.
... skin has metal bands running all over it, forming a kind of net, although it seems weaker around the chest.
... skin has been covered with a thin metal net, although the neck seems not to be covered.
... skin has been covered with a thin, net-like metal coating, although the head seems not to be covered.
Tiny threads of metal run criss-cross all over {His/Her/Your} skin, although the head seems not to be covered.
&lt;/pre>

==Damage notification==
As the shield gets to a damage threshold, you see messages that warns you of this.

With chalk:
&lt;pre>
A crackle of magic runs over your body, rearranging your stony skin.
&lt;/pre>
With latex:
&lt;pre>
A crackle of magic runs over your body, rearranging your elastic skin.
&lt;/pre>
With metal:
&lt;pre>
A crackle of magic runs over your body, rearranging your metallic skin.
&lt;/pre>

==Notes==
*The "rock candy" from the [[Bes Pelargic L-space Bubble]] can be eaten to immediately end the current effects/duration of CCC.

=== Content from Clothing ===
'''Clothing''' is a category of object which can be worn and is made out of cloth or fabric.

[[Clothing with pockets]] are clothes that are [[containers]]. Not all clothes have pockets, but many do.

Some clothes covering some zones get damaged when these zones get hit by attacks, but clothing is not commonly believed to absorb damage from attacks like proper [[armour]] does.{{research}}

Depending on the type of material it is made from clothing will either offer [[temperature|cooling]] or warming to the wearer (this may depend on the environment, as well).

It is unknown if darker-coloured clothes make the wearer harder to see in dark environments and/or when performing covert commands, such as [[hide|hiding]].{{research}}

When fencing or valueing clothing, the [[people.trading.valueing.armour]] skill is used.

[[Layers]]

=== Content from Clothing_with_pockets ===

==Clothes==
Precise weights (as measured on the post office balance) and capacities (figured out by actually putting things into the container) should be bolded.  Weights gotten by hand-weighing the container, and capacities gotten from appraise, shouldn't be.

Clothes change your [[temperature]]. Some clothes provide warmth, some provide cooling, and some provide either based on the environment. For cooling clothes, please test with &lt;code>temp item &lt;clothing>&lt;/code> at Sek's high altar in [[Bes Pelargic]], a [[rainforest]], or during the day outside around the huge rock west of the [[Oasis]] in a room that is "incredibly, unbelievably hot". For warming clothes, please test at the [[Valley of the Listening Monks]] in a room that is "colder than a brass monkey."

This table uses a special template, {{tl|Con}}, to calculate useful ratios from the weight and capacities.  See that template's page for details on using it.
