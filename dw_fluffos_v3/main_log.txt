Welcome to Discworld: the stuff of which dreams are made.
Silently, slowly and surely, Great A'Tuin paddles through space, its
great eyes surveying the dark, empty wastes before and behind it.
Standing on A'Tuin's great back are four enormous elephants, straining
under the colossal weight of the Discworld itself.  It sparkles with
magic, reflects the light of the stars and generally fails to be as
unobtrusive as possible.
A large, floppy, black hat recedes into the distance, somehow looking
satisfied at what it has left behind.

Please imagine a very nice picture of four Elephants standing on the back of
a Turtle (sex unknown) swimming through space.  On the Elephants rests the
Disc of the world, garlanded by the long waterfall at its vast circumference
and domed by the baby blue vault of heaven.  Imagine this, because there is
not enough room here to draw it.

Congratulations on logging onto Discworld for the third time.  Please accept
this cabbage as a token of our appreciation.
|          The air in the arena is slightly musty with sweat and blood from
&          numerous battles between warriors.  In the centre of the arena is a
+\         small pit with a packed dirt floor.  Around the pit are several
*-@      slightly raised benches for spectators to leer, jeer, or cheer for
the warriors.  Mounted on the walls behind the benches are an array
of weapons and armour for when the warriors really want to get
serious.
It is a cool backspindlewinter's morning with a steady breeze and
some puffy clouds.
There is one obvious exit: west.
A cabbage and Headcrusher are standing here.
A pumpkin lantern is dangling from a post.
Inventory regeneration complete.
Headcrusher says: Ready to try beheading then, Trylo? Give it a go.
Hint: Use "hold <weapon>" then "behead headcrusher with <weapon>".

display                        Discworld concepts                       display
Description
Discworld MUD uses a character-based display system.  This system
does not permit layout control but it does provide some controls for
screen size and colours.
Terminal type
By default Discworld assumes the safe terminal mode of 'dumb'. All
text is sent in plain form wrapped and paged according to the default
settings.
If you just wish to enable colour 'term ansi' should do the trick.
If you are using a MUD client you may wish to try 'term network'.
With this setting the MUD will ask your client about its window size
and capabilities.
Rows and Columns
Text on Discworld will be wrapped to whatever width the MUD believes
your display to be.  You can control this with the 'cols' command.
Commands which output multiple lines of text will split the output
into pages corresponding to the number of rows your display has.  You
can change this with the 'rows' command.  If you are using a mud
client with scrollbars you may wish to set this to a very large
number and use your mud client's paging.
MXP
Discworld supports the Mud eXtension Protocol.  This system enables
more sophisticated display control, exits as hyperlinks and so forth.
MXP is supported by some clients including zmud, mushclient and
pueblo.
Colour
Colour is primarily used to classify different types of information.
In the use of colour we follow two precepts.  "less is more" and
"your screen, your colours".
Note that because Discworld uses British English spelling rather than
American English commands will respond to colour rather than color.
Configuring colours
You can configure the colours that messages are displayed in with the
'options colour' command.
User colour
By default other players cannot control the colour of messages on
your screen.  Their entries in 'who', 'refer', 'finger' etc. will be
in your chosen foreground colour.
You can enable user colour with the command 'options output
usercolour = on'.
Note however that some users may choose to have text displayed in
your background colour making it invisible.  Others may use colour to
attempt to con you into thinking you have died, been attacked,
dropped things, you name it, someone has probably tried it.
zMUD Colour
If you use the zMUD client and wish to use its custom colour
capabilities see 'help zmud_colours'

Description
Discworld allows you to customise the colours in which various kinds
of texts are displayed.  This is done primarily through the "options"
system.
To see your current colour settings, use "options colour"; further
colour settings are in "options colour club" (for individual club
channels), "options colour inform" (for informs you have enabled
using the "inform" command), and so on.
To change a colour setting, use: "options colour <event> = <colour>".
This will set all future messages of type <event> to be displayed in
the colour <colour>.  Instead of a colour, you can set the value to
"default" to let the game choose a colour for messages of the given
type), or "none" to have them displayed without colour.
The colour settings for talker channels are tied to the object you
use as a talker (so you will have to set them again if you replace
your talker).  To enable colour on your talker, use "talker colour
on".  To see the colour settings for your talker, use "talker colour
list".  To change the colour for a channel, use "talker colour
<channel> <colour>".
The Basic Colours
Depending on your client and terminal type, there are many colour
options available.  The eight basic colours which nearly all clients
support are:
red
magenta
icterine
green
blue
cyan
white (white)
black (black)
Additional modifiers (which MUD clients often do not fully support)
are:
bold
italic
flash
underline
Modifiers and colours can be combined, giving for instance bold red
or italic underline cyan.  For historical reasons, the colour yellow
is simply an alias for bold icterine.
In addition, most clients allow the use of background colours.  These
can be addressed as b_red, b_magenta and so on.  Background colours
cannot be made bold.
Further Colours
Most modern clients have more extensive colour support.  For these
clients, we have added some further colours, for example: lightblue,
lightyellow, darkgreen, darkcyan, deepmagenta, deepwhite and so on,
orange, rose, chartreuse, violet, azure, springgreen, grey, gold,
silver, copper, bronze, brass, purple, pink, brown, khaki, ecru,
beige, jade, turquoise, olive, lilac, mint, vermilion, sage,
goldenrod, lime, teal, maroon, aquamarine, orchid, puce, topaz,
emerald, cobalt, crimson, and many more.  The complete list of
available colour names can be found in the helpfile:
help colour list
In addition, you can use hexadecimal codes, for example #FFBF00 or
B_#004225.
(NOTE: if these colours just look like the basic eight and their bold
versions to you, you are most likely on term ansi.  Sometimes players
have this setting even when their client also supports more colours;
try setting "term network" to let your client inform us of its
preferences.)

The Discworld Free Love Society set to [bold red]
Extras
Players can also set colours in titles set with a title changer,
tricks, their refer and some other user input.  This is explained in:
help usercolour
To see any such user set colours (including your own!) that do not go
through the options or talker colour control, use the options output
usercolour option.
> options output usercolour=on
The final colour codes to mention are: ansired, ansigreen,
ansiyellow, ansibold, ansiitalic, b_ansiblue, b_ansimagenta and so on
(but only for the ansi colours and the modifiers), as well as
ansireset.  These "colours" are used as overrides: they are ignored
on a terminal with 256 or more colours, but have the expected value
on ansi terminals.  This may be used by players who usually play from
a client with extensive colour support, but occasionally swap to an
alternative which only supports term ansi.
For example, the colour azure is normally displayed as cyan on an
ansi terminal.  The alternative colour group azure ansiblue ansibold
is displayed as azure when viewed on a client with 256-colour
support, but as bold blue when using term ansi.
To see how a colour will look: use "colours test <colour>".  To see
how it will look on an ansi- or xterm256-terminal, use "colours test
ansi <colour>" or "colours test xterm <colour>" respectively.  For
example:
> colours test azure ansiblue ansibold
> colours test ansi azure ansiblue ansibold

Syntax
wimpy <num>
Description
You can set the percentage of your hit points at which you run away.
If you have set the number to zero you are in brave mode and won't
run away even if you are almost dead (in fact even if you are dead).
Caveats
While wimpy is very effective and will generally get you out of harms
way this is not guaranteed.  Even with wimpy you can still die!
Your wimpy setting has a small effect on your XP: the higher your
wimpy is set, the less xp you gain per kill.
Because wimpy stops combat, it's generally a good idea to set it to
zero when engaged in a PK fight.  If you wimpy during a PK fight, and
then some lingering effect of the combat kills you, you will lose a
real life because you will no longer be in combat with a player.

Name
term - Set your terminal type
Syntax
term
term <terminal type>
Description
Term sets your terminal type.  If you experiment with terminal types
it is your own fault if your terminal hangs... which it may do if you
set a term that is not compatible with your client.
Currently supported terms are listed if you type "term" without
further arguments.
Instead of manually setting a term, you can set your terminal type to
'network', which will cause Discworld to use telnet negotiation to
ask your client what its preferred terminal type is.  This is the
default (and recommended) setting.
Different terminal types support different colours.  Some of the
older terminal types do not support colour at all; the terminals
ending in -nc attempt to emulate colour using combinations of bold,
reverse video and underline attributes.  Most terminal types support
at least eight, and usually sixteen colours.  The most common of
these terminal types is ansi.
Modern mud clients (and also most telnet clients) usually support a
wider range of colours.  The most common of these terminal types are
xterm256 and mxp.
To test whether your terminal is set up correctly, use "colours
list".  This should show you a list of different colours.  If some of
them are white (or black) when they shouldn't be, your terminal is
most likely set to a value not supported by your client.  Note that
on ansi terminal, many of those colours look the same.

Name
cols - Set the number of columns on your screen.
Syntax
options terminal cols=[number]
Description
The cols command is used to set the number of columns of the terminal
that you are using to play the mud.  The default depends on your
terminal type, if it is set to "network" and your terminal supports
it there should be no need to use this command.  If you use another
terminal type or if your terminal doesn't support the "network"
terminal type it is set to 79.  This is also the value used if you
try to set it to anything that is not a valid value.  Typing just
cols will print the current value.

Rows is used to set the number of rows on your display that you are

Name

Syntax
syntax <verb>
Description
This command allow you to see what syntaxes are allowed for a certain
command.  The syntaxes are the patterns which are matched when a
particular command is attempted.
Example
> syntax read
The syntaxes available for the command 'read':
read <object>
> syntax bow
The syntaxes available for the command 'bow':
bow
bow [to] <any-living>
bow <string>
bow <string> [to] <any-living>
>
What do all these things mean?  Well, they all specify how the
command will be parsed.  The things inside '<' and '>' are special
matching specifiers.  They can be one of the following below:
object              Any object in your
inventory or on the
ground.
any-living          Any living person
anywhere in the game,
this allows you to deal
with people not in the
same room with you.
distant-living      Any living object that
is not in the same room
as you.
living              Any living person in the
same room with you.
preposition         A preposition is a sort
of joining word.  They
are things like 'on',
'from', 'under', just
put in what feels most
comfortable to you.
string              A collection of words.
Will match 1 or more
words.
word                A single word.
number              A number, the number
must be in numerical
format.  It does not
handle numbers as words
(currently).
fraction            A special sort of
number, it is specified
as something like 12/2,
or whatever.
If the words are enclosed in '{' and '}' then it is a list of
required words.  For instance if there was a {bing|red|blue} in the
pattern string, then the pattern would match either bing, red or blue
in that place.  One of these words MUST be there for the pattern to
match.
If the words are enclosed in '[' and ']' then it is a list of
optional words.  It is parsed the same as the list above, except this
parameter is optional and you do not need to fill it in.
Inside the '[', ']' something may be specified in '<', '>'.  They
have the same meaning as in the '<', '>' table shown above, except
they are optional.
If there is nothing enclosing the words.  Then they are required
parameter and they must be typed in as shown.
Good luck! - Pinkfish.

parser                       Discworld Player Help                       parser
Name
parser - the Discworld object parser
Description
The Discworld object parser allows you to interact with objects in
many different ways.
So if you have a blue frog in your inventory, you can type 'look at
frog' or 'look at blue frog'.
If you have several types of the same object, you can refer to it
with a number or an ordinal.  For example, 'blue frog 1' or '3rd blue
frog'.
You can refer to several types of the same object by specifying the
number of objects you want to use.  For example, '1 blue frog' or
'twenty blue frogs'.
You can also interact with objects in containers by using 'in'.  For
example, 'look at beer in bottle'.
You can interact with several things at once by using ',' and '&'.
Typing 'look at frog,womble' will allow you to look at both objects,
but only if both objects are present.  Typing 'look at frog & womble'
however, will allow you to look at the frog even if the womble isn't
present and vice versa.
If you only want to interact with objects that lie in the room, then
you can use 'here'.  For example, 'look at green bottle here' If you
only want to interact with objects that lie in your inventory then
you can use 'my'.  For example, 'look at my shoes'.
You can also specify random objects to match from a group with the
'random' keyword.
You can reference all items with 'every', e.g. 'take every coin from
corpse'.  You can also reference everything except something else,
e.g. 'take every coin except coin 1'.
Living things can be specified with the 'living' keyword.  This
allows you to reference living things without referencing non-living
things.
The mud remembers what you last referenced, so you can reference them
again with 'it', 'them', 'him', 'her' keywords.  If for example, you
have just looked at somebody and want to look at her socks you can
type 'look socks on her'.  If you have just looked at a cabbage, you
can pick it up with 'get it', and so on.
You can change how precisely you want to target stuff with the option
'input ambiguous'.  If you are a complete control freak who always
wants to specify precisely which object you are referring to then try
setting 'options input ambiguous = on', otherwise leaving it 'off'
might be better.  This means that you can omit certain bits of an
item's specification when you do something to it.  E.g. You have
three candles.  You want to light one.  Having the option 'on' you
cannot do 'light candle' (would result in a parser error), having it
'off' you can.  Having it on you would have to use either 'light
candle 1', 'light candle 2', or 'light candle 3'.
It is also possible to turn on and off the processing of 'and' as a
break word or as (part of) an adjective.  If you use 'options input
andascomma = on' you will turn on the possibility to use 'and' as if
it was a comma.  If you turn this to off then you can use it as part
of an adjective and reference things like 'red and blue jacket'.
The 'shorthand' option will expand things like 'u' to 'you' if you
set it to 'on'.
Examples
> look at quill,frog
> look at quill&frog
> look at bottle in bucket
> look at blue frog
> look at 2nd red towel
> look at 20 gold coins
> look at cupcake here
> look at random flower
> look at my badge
> look at her badge
> look at his jacket
> look at it
> look at living beggar
The beggar's life span looks exceptionally short.

Syntax
options earmuff

options earmuff events <type>=[on|off]
Description
'options earmuff' by itself displays information saying whether your
earmuffs are currently on or off.  'options earmuff events' shows
which things you currently have earmuffed.
'options earmuff state=on' turns on the blocking.  All of the events
you have set to be blocked will be blocked from this time on, you
won't see them.  The off parameter turns off the blocking.  The
status of the blocking is independent of the actual events being
blocked.
'options earmuff state=allowfriends' turns on the blocking, but it
allows all of your friends to still communicate with you.  It blocks
everyone else.
The last thing you can do with the command is turn on and off the
blocking of the various events.  If you don't specify on or off after
the type the value is toggled.  If you put an on or off there it is
set to that value.

Syntax
inform
inform [all/none/on/off]
inform <type> [on/off] [<type> [on/off]] ...
Description
With this command you set which special messages you are informed of.
If you specify no arguments it will tell you what you are currently
being informed of and whether inform is on or off.
The inform messages can be suppressed or unsuppressed with "inform
off" and "inform on".  Suppressing the inform messages does not
change which types of messages you will be informed of, it just stops
you being told about them until you turn them on again.
The all keyword makes you be informed of all possible event types.
You can specifically turn on and off informing of certain types of
events.  If you do not specify whether it should be on or off it
toggles the status of the event.
The type of inform events are as follows:
achievement: shown when players attain achievements of moderate level
or higher
birthday: shown when a player logs in on their birthday
blog: shown when a new entry is made to the creators' blog
council: will display council events
cpu: shows you information on how well A'tuin is doing
event: shown when a new player-run event is added or is soon to start
friend: will display people on your friends list in a special colour
guild-logon: shows you when members of your guild log in or out
group-request: shows you when someone makes a grouping request
logon: will show which players are logging in and which are logging
out
new-player: will show you who logs in for the first time
roleplaying: shows when someone starts or stops roleplaying actively

command line prefaced with a ~.  ie ~h is for help.  Ed is the editor
that some people love and hate.  Please do not try this editor unless
you have used it before, or are feeling particularly masochistic.

roleplaying                  Discworld Player help                  roleplaying
What is roleplaying?
Roleplaying is when a person creates a persona for their game
character and tries to faithfully portray that persona with its
strengths and weaknesses, virtues and foibles.  When playing
Discworld in this way a roleplayer will likely act rather differently
to someone who is treating the game as a competition.
Conventions
Roleplayers tend to divide their communication and actions into two
categories.  In character (IC) and out of character (OOC).  In
character is when the player is roleplaying the character, out of
character is when they're just chatting with friends or need to
discuss game mechanics.
Supported, not required
Unlike some other virtual worlds out there, you are not required to
roleplay on Discworld.  However, if you are into roleplaying, you
will find there is a sizeable group of players on the mud for you to
play with and Discworld tries to support those who choose to roleplay
and those who choose not to.
What kind of role you want to play is entirely up to you, although we
do prefer you to stay in the setting of Discworld.  (This is hardly a
constraint; since this is such an eclectic place, it would be
difficult to actually find a role that would not fit with the
possible exception of a Tolkien elf :)
Roleplayers on Discworld usually build their characters on guild
identities.  Apart from that, they form their characters with lots of
humour and the numerous resources the mud has to offer: clothing,
emotional expression, character description, titles, the numerous
ways of communication, etc.
Roleplaying mode
To support the roleplaying community, you can enable roleplaying mode
with the command "roleplaying immersive". When you put your character
in this mode a number of commands work in a more in character manner.
For example "score" no longer shows numbers but gives a textual
description of your status. For example:
> score
You are Ceres the Recruit in the Djelian Guard.
You are in perfect health and you are full of energy.
You should consider training your skills.
You are evil and in the service of Pishe, the Goddess of Slight Showers.
You will not flee.
You are unburdened and quite comfortable.
You have an "arrangement" with Death.
In addition many out of character commands (such as tell and remote
souls) are disabled and others will be unable to use those commands
on you.
If you would like to use the descriptive output for scores, skills
and certain other commands, but not block remote communication, then
you can use "options output numbers = descriptive".  If you would
like to block remote communication but not receive descriptive
output, then use the earmuff command.
Roleplaying board
There is a roleplaying board in the Patrician's palace.  Please use
it in a nice way, in character or out of character.  It might give
you good ideas and also show you who else is interested in
roleplaying.
Roleplayers and non-roleplayers
Please respect other players' style of playing, even if it is not
yours.  Non-roleplayers may get a little confused with you.  In
addition if you are not roleplaying please respect others who wish to
roleplay.  Also remember that a roleplayer who comes across as
brusque or rude may simply be playing their role, it may not be
personal!
Creator interaction
When dealing with creators, coders and liaisons alike, remember that
they have a job to do and you should consider all creator interaction
as out of character.

monitor - Hit point monitor.
Syntax
monitor [off|on|slow|snail's pace]
monitor show
monitor default
monitor <string>
Description
Monitor is a hit point monitor that goes on during combat.  This
tells you the current state of your hit points and guild points.
"monitor" by itself will show the current monitor status (i.e. off or
on), and "monitor show" will show what it looks like when it fires..
It is also possible to customise your monitor.  To do this use the
"monitor <string>" syntax with the string you want displayed.
Certain control codes will be replaced in your string.  These are:
$hp$                Your current amount of hit points.
$maxhp$             Your maximum amount of hit points.
$gp$                Your current amount of guild points.
$maxgp$             Your maximum amount of guild points.
$xp$                Your current amount of experience points.
$hp_rp$             A textual description of your current hit point
status.
$gp_rp$             A textual description of your current guild point
status.
$burden$            Your current burden %.
$burden_rp$         A textual description of your current burden.
$temp$              An indication of your temperature.
$align$             An indication of your alignment.
$hurtcolour$        A colour tag representing how hurt you are.
Needs to be closed with the code $reset$.
$newline$           A newline.
$servertime$        A string indicating the current server time.
$localtime$         A string indicating the current time in your
personal timezone (if set).
$combat_attitude$   Your current combat attitude tactics.
$combat_response$   Your current combat response tactics.
$reset$             Reset colour code.
If you set the monitor to default, a default string will be used.
This is "$hurtcolour$You are $hp_rp$ and $gp_rp$.$reset$" if you are
in roleplaying mode, and "$hurtcolour$Hp: $hp$ ($maxhp$) Gp: $gp$
($maxgp$) Xp: $xp$$reset$" if you're not.  If you set a custom
monitor, it will be used regardless of roleplaying status.
Examples
> monitor on
Your hit point monitor is set to on.
> monitor slow
Your hit point monitor is set to slow.
> monitor

whether you have completed them or not.
There are four types of hints available for quests: general,
location, item and NPC hints. The "quests show
{general|location|item|npc} hint for <quest>" syntax will show the
first hint of the specified type and the "next" option will show the
next hint.
If you want more detailed location, item or NPC information the
"quests show {solution|location|item|npc} [details] for <quest>"
syntax should be used. Note that the "solution" option will show the
full solution for the quest.

Description
Quests are, in essence, puzzles that have been worked into the game.
For example, a number centre around finding items and returning them
to NPCs - Non-Player Characters, another word for the "monsters" that
populate the game.  Others involve figuring out how to get somewhere,
or how to do a particular thing. Sometimes completing a quest even
gives you a neat reward!
Now comes the important part of this help file: There is a webpage
with hints and full solutions located at:
http://discworld.atuin.net/lpc/secure/quests.c
Note that some players get a lot of satisfaction by completing the
quests by themselves.  If you discuss how to solve a quest on a
public channel or by shouting it, you're probably ruining the
experience for many others.  If you're desperate you can ask another
player in a "tell" for some kind of additional hint or insight.
I repeat:  Quests are not for discussion on any public channel.

Guild points - a measure of your capability
Description
Guild points are a measure of your capability.  As you perform guild
commands such as stealing, sneaking or slashing you use guild points.
When you have used all your guild points you will need to rest before
you can perform anymore such commands.
The number of your guild points is determined by your "point" skills;
guild points are divided into different skill categories.  The 'gp'
command will tell you how many guild points you have and how many you
can use on different types of commands.
Guild points regenerate automatically with time. You can also regain
a small amount by using the bury command.

Syntax
who [verbose|[filter 1, filter 2, ...][& filter 3, filter 4, ...]...]
Description
When used with no parameters who gives a short list of who is online.
When used with the 'verbose' parameter it gives the long information
about who is online, shows their status, their guild rank and any
other pertinent information.
Optionally you can provide a list of filters in which case only
members of the filter you give are listed.  For a list of the various
filters see below.  If you specify a '-' in front of the name of the
filter (ie: -creator) then it will show the members that are not in
that filter list.
You can show an intersection of people on as well using the '&'
connector.  So 'who killers & thieves' would show all the player
killer thieves.

alias                        Discworld player help                        alias
Name
A short introduction to the Discworld alias system.
Introduction
The alias command basically allows you to create shortcuts for
commands.  In its most simple form, an alias allows you to rename a
command, but you can do fairly complicated things with them as well.
This help file aims to give an introduction to making and using
aliases.  It does not cover complicated alias patterns or alias
categories.  If you want an explanation of all the syntaxes of the
command, or a tutorial to writing more advanced aliases, check help
alias tutorial.
How to use aliases
In its most basic form, you can use an alias to shorten other
commands, and to combine a number of commands.  The following
examples demonstrate how it is done.
> alias align score align
> alias bs backstab
> alias pp put $*$ in pack
> alias halfdrink get $*$ from pack; drink 1/2 of $*$; pp $*$
The first command creates an alias "align".  After creating this
alias, if you type "align" the mud will execute "score align".  The
second alias demonstrates another feature: aliases can take
arguments.  If you type "bs beggar", the mud will execute "backstab
beggar".
The third command demonstrates how to put arguments elsewhere in your
command.  The $*$ is replaced by whatever you put after the alias.
So for example typing "pp money" would have the mud execute "put
money in pack".
Finally, you can use a semi-colon to execute several commands in one
go, as demonstrated in the fourth example.
Special Aliases
If you create an alias login, it will be executed when you login; the
alias afterinventory will be executed after your inventory
regeneration.  Aliases .plan and .project affect your finger
information.
Final notes
You can check all your aliases by simply typing "alias" or view a
summary of your aliases with "qalias".  You can get rid of an
unwanted alias with the command "unalias".
As mentioned before, the examples given here are only the tip of the
iceberg (although the tip that you will probably use most).  For a
complete tutorial, see help alias tutorial.  For a more in-depth
explanation of the unalias command, see help unalias.

Name
Unalias - getting rid of aliases
Syntax
> unalias <alias>
> unalias pattern <alias>
> unalias all
Introduction
The unalias command allows you to remove an alias.  You can either
remove a specific alias (using unalias <alias name>), remove all
aliases (unalias all) or unalias everything with a fixed pattern.
Unaliasing by pattern
"unalias pattern" removes all aliases whose name starts with a given
pattern.  The pattern is a regular expression.  We will not go into
deep details here of how regular expressions work, but as a basic
overview, these are the most common special symbols:
.  matches a single letter
*  matches zero or more of the previous symbol
+  matches one or more of the previous symbol
$  matches the end of the string
For example:
"unalias pattern test" will remove alias "test", "testthingy",
"testworld" and everything else that starts with test.   "unalias
pattern test$" will remove alias "test", but not "testest" or
"testworld".  "unalias pattern t.t" will remove any alias that starts
with "tat", "tot", "trt", for example; "test" will not be matched.
"unalias pattern t.*t$" will unalias anything that both begins and
ends with "t", with any number of characters (including zero!) in
between.  "unalias pattern a+b" will unalias everything that starts
with a number of a's followed by a b, for example an alias aaaaaabc.
You can do a lot more things than this with regular expressions (many
examples can be found on the web), but they are beyond the scope of
this help file.
A note of warning: it is very easy to accidently unalias more than
you had intended when playing with unalias pattern.  Use with care!

Description
There are a number of combat options that you can set to determine
your tactics in a fight - you can change these settings at any time,
even during the middle of a fight, to change your tactics.  The first
option is your attitude: you can be on the offensive (in which case
you get a bonus to attacking, but a penalty to dodging and parrying),
or on the defensive (in which case you get a bonus to dodging and
parrying, but a penalty to attacking) or you can take a neutral
attitude (in which case there are no bonuses or penalties).
In dealing with an attack, you can choose your response: you can
always dodge or you can always parry or you can be neutral in your
response. When using neutral response there is a slight bonus since
your opponent doesn't know if you will dodge or parry.
For parrying, you can choose whether to always parry with the weapon,
or shield, in your left or right hand or always attempt to use the
weapons, or weapon and shield, in both hands.
If you are fighting unarmed, you can choose to attempt to parry with
your arm or hand (this special manoeuvre can be disabling if you are
not skillful enough, but would prevent an attack from reaching your
more vital areas).
You can control your mercy: always accept surrenders, never accept
surrenders, or ask whether or not to accept surrenders.
Note: Surrendering might not be possible currently.
You can focus on a specific part of an opponent's body. While this
makes it more difficult to hit the opponent, it may enable you to
cause a greater degree of injury if you do get the hit(s) in. With
different races the part you have chosen to target will be mapped
onto that race's body.
It is important to realise that for best results, the tactics that
you choose should depend on your armoury, your opponents and the
armouries of your opponents - no two fights will ever be quite the
same.
Note
The distance and mercy options are currently disabled, they may be
enabled in the future.

Character Profiles
Alice the Assassin wears typical assassin's clothing, but carries
around rather a lot of the hardware typical to the trade.  After a
successful inhumation, she wields a rapier and a dagger and attempts
to make good her escape from the scene.  Since she is mostly
interested in getting away, she sets her combat attitude to
defensive; given the weight of the tools that she carries, she sets
her combat response to parry and chooses to always parry with the
dagger in her left hand in order to protect her more delicate rapier.
Birzig the Barbarian wears the standard leather garment, a cloak made
from the wool of Hublandish sheep and a pair of fur-lined boots.  He
carries little beyond a small satchel and his trusty bastard sword.
Since his goal is to defeat his enemies, he sets his combat attitude
to offensive and his response to neutral, since given the little he
carries he can either dodge or parry with his bastard sword.

Description
WARNING: This code is only in the game for playtesters.  Don't risk
your life on this code!
Combat is, by its very nature, dangerous.  Usually at least one
person will die, and everyone is nearly guaranteed to suffer at least
some damage.
Further, killing someone is an inherently evil act: though the forces
of good acknowledge its usefulness, they are forced to hold combat as
a last resort for fear of becoming tainted as their enemies.
For this reason, the concept of 'mercy' has arisen among the fighting
classes.  If a person is outclassed, they can kneel down and beg for
mercy, in the hopes that their opponent will spare their life.
When a person accepts your surrender, your life is spared.  The price
is that that person then has the option of taking any and all of your
equipment that they wish.  But after all, you are still alive...  You
can't leave the room or the game until your opponent has taken what
they want.  Then you're free to go about your business, a bit lighter
in property and hit points.
When you accept someone's surrender, you can't fight them any more.
You get experience points and an alignment boost as if you had killed
them, but the alignment boost is weighted slightly towards the good
side, since you spared their life.  You also get to take any of their
equipment that catches your fancy.  After 5 minutes, or if you leave
the room, they are free to go about their business.

Syntax
accept <name>
Description
WARNING: This code is still in development.  Don't risk your life on
this code!
During combat, other players and NPCs may occasionally offer a
surrender to you.  This generally occurs because you're  soundly
whupping their butt, but there are other possible causes.
If you are feeling in a merciful mood today, you can accept their
surrender with this command.  You will be told precisely what you
need to type to accept their surrender when the surrender is offered.
This command is also used to accept an offer of a sale from someone
else.
Examples
> accept sin
You accept Sin's surrender.

skills                      Discworld concepts help                      skills
Name
skills - How good you are at things and how to get better.
Description
Discworld uses a hierarchical skill system.  A player has skills
numbering into the hundreds in which they can improve and train.
The hierarchy of skills
Each skill falls into one of seven top-level groups: adventuring,
covert, crafts, faith, fighting, magic and people.  Each of these
groups is then further subdivided as necessary.
For example, magic skills are divided up into magic.spells,
magic.methods, magic.items and magic.points.  Next, magic.spells is
divided into magic.spells.offensive, magic.spells.defensive,
magic.spells.misc and magic.spells.special - none of these skills
have subskills, so the subdivision ends there.
Viewing your skills
To find out what skills you have, use the "skills" command.  Used on
its own, this will show you all your skills.  You can also view only
a subset of these by using for example "skills magic", "skills
magic.spells" and so on.  The output of the skills command will show
two numbers associated with each skill.  The first of these is your
level and the second is your bonus - see "Using your skills" below
for more information on bonuses.
Advancing your skills
When you start out as a new character, you may not immediately be
able to advance the "branch" skills such as magic.spells.misc,
because you can only advance skills that you have at least depth*5
skill levels in.
For example, if you have no magic skills at all, the only thing in
the magic skilltree that you will be able to advance is magic itself.
Once you have 5 levels of magic, you can start advancing
magic.spells.  Once you have 10 levels of magic.spells, you can start
advancing magic.spells.offensive.
Skill levels can be advanced at your guild, by teaching yourself, or
by learning from other players.  If you aren't sure which skills you
should advance, you might want to try asking other players on the
talker (see "help talker").
Using your skills
When it comes to using your skills, it is generally your bonus in
each skill that is relevant, rather than your level in that skill.
Although your bonus in a skill is partly determined by your level in
that skill, it is also affected by your stats.  There are five stats
- constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength and wisdom.  To
view your stats, type "score stats".  To see how a given skill
depends on your stats, use the "skills" command, for example "skills
magic.points stats".  See "help stats" for more.

Description
This command gives you a list of your currently learned guild and
skills related commands.  An example of such a command is judge.  The
commands should also have help available on them.
The default behaviour of the command is to print out the details in
an area based output.  An area based output groups all the commands
into various areas and then prints them out based on that area.  If
you show the commands combined it shows them all in one group.
Using the 'clear' syntax you can clear out a specific one of your
commands if you do not want it any more for some reason.

Name
rearrange - Rearrange your stats.
Syntax
rearrange
Description
You will be allowed once during your character's life to modify the
stats that you start with.  Stats take the range of 8 to 23.  You can
make your stats what you want them to be by typing rearrange and
following the instructions.  The idea of this command is to make your
character what you want it to be.  You should also read the help on
stats to find out what each of them does.
Don't play with this until you have decided what you want your
character to be like.  You do not need to rearrange your stats very
early on in the game, so spend some time playing with your character
and getting the feel of how things work before you make a decision
about how you wish to set your stats.
Retrophrenology
While you will only ever get one chance to rearrange, there are a
number of NPCs around the Disc, known as retrophrenologists, who will
let you move one stat point at a time - but this comes at a price.

help stats
stats                       Discworld concepts help                       stats
Description
When it comes to applying your knowledge, in the form of your levels
in the various skills, it is very often the case that your bonus in a
skill is used, rather than your level.  The bonus provides a much
more relevant measure of how good you are at something, since it
takes into account your natural ability in the form of your stats.
There are five stats, which you may view at any time with "score
stats", and they are constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength
and wisdom.  Your array of stats forms what wizards term your anima,
as opposed to your skills which form your animus.
Constitution
Your constitution is a measure of how healthy you are, and is
frequently used to determine whether you succumb to disease or
poison.  Amongst other skills, it is important for your bonus in
"adventuring.health" and hence the number of hit points you have.
Dexterity
Your dexterity determines how agile and graceful you are.  It will be
used to determine  how you land from a fall and is used in the
determination of the bonus for many skills, for example
"fighting.defence.dodging", "magic.methods.physical" and, of course,
many of the "covert" skills - a good dexterity is a must for any
decent thief or assassin.
Intelligence
Your intelligence reflects how bright you are and determines how able
you are at figuring things out for yourself.  It is the most
important stat for bonuses in "magic", so it is very important for
wizards and witches, but it also plays a part in such skills as
"covert.casing", "faith.items" and a number of the more mental
skills, including "people.valuing" and "adventuring.evaluating".
Strength
Your strength is a measure of your physical power and build.  Its
most obvious role is in determining how much you are able to carry.
A fighter will need a good strength as it is the main stat used for
calculating "fighting" bonuses, with dexterity not far behind, and is
also used for "crafts.smithing.black" and the more physical
"adventuring" skills.
Wisdom
Your wisdom is a reflection of the power of your intuition and common
sense.  It is by far the most important stat for priests, in that it
determines bonuses in "faith", and is also used for
"magic.methods.spiritual" and a number of the more mental skills,
including "adventuring.perception".
Setting Stats
All of your stats start out at 13.  Once you have chosen a guild to
join, you will probably want to make use of "rearrange" to set your
stats appropriately for that guild.  The command lets you set each
stat to any value between 8 and 23, so long as the total is still 65
or less, and once used, you lose the command, so make sure you do it
right as you only get one chance.
You do not need to rearrange your stats very early on in the game,
spend some time playing with your character getting the feel of how
things work and talking to other members of your guild before you
make a decision about how you wish to set your stats with the
rearrange command.
Again, you may only rearrange once.
Changing Stats
There are various ways to modify your stats.  The most common way is
to change them temporarily, for instance, a ritual or potion might
give you more points in one or more stats for a short time.  Another
way is through magic items which change your stats indefinitely,
although there will always be a price to pay for the change and as
soon as you can no longer pay the price, your stats will revert.
Just as there are ways to improve your stats, there will be things
that reduce them; contracting a disease might reduce your strength,
while wearing awkward clothing or heavy armour might lower your
dexterity.
There may be particular places available in-game, where a service to
change your stats is offered, usually for a fee of some kind.  This
may allow you to tweak your one or more stats very slightly.
Should you ever be unfortunate enough to meet Death, all of your
stats will be temporarily lowered, although there are ways to be
restored more quickly than by simply waiting.

taskmaster                  Discworld concepts help                  taskmaster
Name
The taskmaster system - The system to improve skills by practice.
Description
There are a variety of ways to gain expertise in skills.  You could
spend time and effort in learning from another person - or yourself.
You could undertake a quest and be given an experience reward for
completing it successfully, which you can then spend at your guild in
exchange for skill levels.  Another common method is through the
taskmaster system.
The taskmaster system is just a simple, generic procedure for
improving a skill by practising it - that is, by attempting a task
that requires some level of ability in the skill.  Each task requires
a certain amount of skill at which you begin to start succeeding if
you attempt it; there is another, higher threshold, beyond which you
will always succeed because you have mastered that particular task.
Between these two thresholds, you could attempt the task and fail or
you could attempt the task and succeed,  and in either case there is
a chance that you learn something from the attempt and gain a level
in the skill used.  When you gain a skill level from the taskmaster
system, it is often shortened to "TM".
Examples
* Sneaking along a street could improve in covert.stealth.outside.
* Fighting with a sword could improve in fighting.melee.sword.
* Using religious artifacts could improve in faith.items.rods.
* Flying with your broomstick could improve in magic.items.held.broom.
* Casting a fire spell could improve in magic.methods.elemental.fire.
* Climbing a tree could improve in adventuring.movement.climbing.tree.

Name
inform - Toggle the inform channel on and off.
Syntax
inform
inform [all/none/on/off]
inform <type> [on/off] [<type> [on/off]] ...
Description
With this command you set which special messages you are informed of.
If you specify no arguments it will tell you what you are currently
being informed of and whether inform is on or off.
The inform messages can be suppressed or unsuppressed with "inform
off" and "inform on".  Suppressing the inform messages does not
change which types of messages you will be informed of, it just stops
you being told about them until you turn them on again.
The all keyword makes you be informed of all possible event types.
You can specifically turn on and off informing of certain types of
events.  If you do not specify whether it should be on or off it
toggles the status of the event.
The type of inform events are as follows:
achievement: shown when players attain achievements of moderate level
or higher
birthday: shown when a player logs in on their birthday
blog: shown when a new entry is made to the creators' blog
council: will display council events
cpu: shows you information on how well A'tuin is doing
event: shown when a new player-run event is added or is soon to start
friend: will display people on your friends list in a special colour
guild-logon: shows you when members of your guild log in or out
group-request: shows you when someone makes a grouping request
logon: will show which players are logging in and which are logging
out
new-player: will show you who logs in for the first time
roleplaying: shows when someone starts or stops roleplaying actively
Example
> inform logon on
You will now be informed of logon events.

Name

Pinkfish's soul.
How to use (What can it do for you?):
The feeling or atmosphere commands that you use, like smile and so on
come from your soul.  The soul used on this mud is different to most
others you will have come across.  Below are a few examples of what
you can do with this soul.
> smile happily at furball
You smile happily at furball.
> smile w at furball
You smile wryly at furball
> shake hands with furball
You shake hands with furball
> shake hands furball
You shake hands with furball.
The above are a few examples of what can be done with the soul.  The
usage of the command (i.e. whether you use and at or a with or
whatever... well, just use what seems right... It should work)  To
see what soul commands are available to you at any given time type
> look soul
Here are the commands in this hoopy soul.

<complete list of souls omitted in this helpfile>
You can also see the current list of soul commands on the Discworld
website and the URL is: http://discworld.atuin.net/lpc/playing/soul.c
Any of the soul commands displayed in the long list have help
available for them.  This help shows you all the valid methods of
using the soul command and all the valid adverbs to the commands.  To
find the ways you can use a soul, try 'syntax <soul command>' or
'help <soul command>'.
The first one of the options is the default.  You can select the
others by doing things like
> shake head
You shake your head.
> waggle eyebrows pinkfish
You waggle your eyebrows at Ms Pinkfish.
Womble on.
Disambiguation
Sometimes soul commands may clash with other game commmands.  If
you're having a problem with this any soul can be preceded by the
word 'soul'.
Correspondingly, if you find yourself wanting to use a game command
that is also a soul, and the soul insists on taking precedence, you
can prepend the command line with 'nosoul' to force it to use the
game command only.
Colours
You can turn on and off the display of colours in souls directed at
you using the command 'options output usercolour'.  This allows you
to choose if you wish to receive coloured souls or not.  You can also
set the colour of the souls you receive using 'options colour soul'.
Examples
> options colour soul = yellow
Set option colour soul to [yellow].
> options output usercolour = on
Set option output usercolour to on.
Idea reporting souls
If you find a missing command use the following command to get it
added by someone who can.

And Finally
Please be aware that some players may find certain souls offensive or
overly intimate.  Please consider whether the recipient is likely to
object to the gesture before using commands that suggest any degree
of physical intimacy with another player.

Syntax
hsoul [{brief|verbose}]
hsoul [{brief|verbose}] player
hsoul [{brief|verbose}] <number>
hsoul [{brief|verbose}] <number> hours
hsoul [{brief|verbose}] search <name>
Description
The history of your souls.  It shows you the last few soul commands
made to you by other people as well as the souls you made to them.
Emotes are also included.
By default, souls are shown together with the date and time they were
made.  If you set "brief htell", then date and time will not be shown
(this setting also affects brevity of other communication history
commands, such as htell and hcomm).  If you want to bypass your
setting, just specify "hsoul brief" or "hsoul verbose" directly.
When using "hsoul search" followed by a name, you will only be shown
souls to and from that specific person.  If you use hsoul followed by
a number, you only see that number of souls.  When using the "hsoul
<number> hours" syntax, you will be shown only souls in the last
given number of hours.
Of course, not only other players use soul commands and emotes, but
also non-player characters.  To see only chats by other players, use
the "hsoul player" command.  Since player-souls are saved separately,
this may sometimes show messages which do show up directly in
"hsoul".
Example
> hsoul
** <random time> **
Bluewiz huggles you.
** <random time> **
The mynah bird flaps her wings.
> hsoul brief player
Bluewiz huggles you.

By default, tells are shown together with the date and time they were
made.  If you set "brief htell", then date and time will not be
shown.  If you want to bypass your setting, just specify "htell
brief" or "htell verbose" directly.
When using "htell search" followed by a name, you will only be shown
tells to and from that specific person.  If you use htell followed by
a number, you only see that number of tells.  When using the "htell
<number> hours" syntax, you will be shown only tells in the last
given number of hours.
Example
> htell
** <random time> **
Bluewiz tells you: You have seven legs and a couple of extra heads.

help tell
tell                         Discworld player help                         tell
Name
tell - Tell another player something.
Syntax
tell <player> [@adverb] <message>
tell reply [@adverb] <message>
tell replylock <names>
tell replylock remove
Description
Tell is used to tell someone something who is not in the room with
you.  It will tell the player the message in the following manner.
If you are Pinkfish and you type 'tell shadow bing', shadow will
receive the message
Pinkfish tells you: bing
This is the main way of communicating with people not in the same
room as you on the mud or in real life :)
The reply option to tell allows you to reply to the last person  (or
persons) to tell you something.  The people that told you is
remembered for 15 minutes.  Please remember that this is a very
dangerous way to chat and it is way open to mischats from someone
dropping in a random tell to you on the way.  This can be got around
with "tell replylock", which will lock a person (or persons) into the
people you send a tell reply to.
The @ can be used to use a specific adverb to the tell.  For example
using tell ceres @happily Hello will cause the recipient to be told
that you tell them 'happily'.  If you do not wish to receive the
emotions in tells sent to you, you can set your "tell" information to
be brief and it will cut this out.
Note that '#<language>' cannot be used with this command, since tells
are out-of-character communication, and hence language-independent.
Examples
> tell pinkfish frog
> tell ben We are all going to Subiaco to buy some coke.  Back soon.
> tell ember fix it, fix it.
> tell pinkfish,bil I am older than macaroni.
> tell reply fluff in space!
> tell ceres @happily This is happily.
> tell replylock sasquatch,ceres
You lock in sasquatch and ceres in your reply list.
Womble tells you: Hi
> tell reply Bing
You tell Sasquatch and Ceres: Bing
>tell replylock remove
You remove any possible reply locks.
> tell ceres @happily This is happily.

Description
Say sends the message to all of the people in the room.  If you were
in a room and Furball had said 'hello' then you would see:
Furball says: hello
This is the main method of communicating on the mud.
The # and @ can be used to use a specific language and an adverb to
the message.  You can use partial matching for a language, so for
example #dj will make you speak in djelian.  You may also put the
language name in quotes after the # to speak in languages which have
spaces in them.
There is an option to do with accents that allows you to see the text
mangled, or a short string saying what the accent is.  Use the option
output accent to set the behaviour.
Examples
> say hello
> 'hello
> say I am pleased to meet you.
> 'I am pleased to meet you.
> say @happily I found my frog!
> say #djelian @happily This is in djelian.
> say #'djelian' @happily This is in djelian.

the default colours the mud returns.  So you can make red into
something entirely different if you wish.
The mxp percentage syntax allows you to lighten up the default
colours by the specific percentage amount.
The mxp default syntax lets you set the mxp colours back to the
original defaults.  While the restore command sends the mxp colour
remappings back to the client to fix up the colour colours.

What is MXP?
MXP, short for MUD eXtension Protocol, was devised as a way to give
MUDs a way to have, when a compatible client is used, greater control
over formatting and provide more ways of for players to interact with
the MUD output.  On Discworld, this means two things: support for far
more colours than the ANSI standard (millions!) and clickable links
and dropdown menus in the MUD output.
Colours
MXP provides support for approximately 16 million colours.  To enable
MXP colour mode, you will need to change your terminal setting to MXP
by using "term mxp".
Colours in MXP are encoded using the HTML-like #RRGGBB syntax, with
each of the three colour fields holding a hexadecimal value from 00
to FF.  This means that you will be able to specify any colour MXP
supports in any options colour setting, as well as in output that
uses colour codes.
Standard colours ("blue" and so forth) are automatically converted
into the appropriate MXP/HTML colour codes by the MUD driver.  To
control the appearance of these, the "mxp" command can be used.  The
"mxp <colour name> <colour code>" syntax will map that name to the
colour code provided, while "mxp defaults" will restore all the
colours to their default values.  In some cases, mxp colours can
disappear when you lose your link (i.e. go netdead), which "mxp
restore" will fix for you should it occur.
Interactive Output
In addition to more colours, MXP provides for clickable things in the
MUD output.  These fall into two categories: links and dropdown
menus.
Links are enabled by default whenever MXP is enabled.  These, when
clicked, will either send a command to the MUD or open a webpage
(though the latter is not currently used on Discworld).  To enable or
disable this, along with the dropdown menus, use "options mxp enabled
= <on/off>".
Discworld's MXP implementation also provides the capability to enable
dropdown menus with commonly used commands (although not all of these
will be applicable to the object in question) when the name of a
person or object appears.  These are toggled separately for living
and nonliving things, with "options mxp livingmenus" and "options mxp
objectmenus".
How can you use MXP?
A number of MUD clients have built in support for MXP.  MUSHclient,
zMUD/CMUD, and coldbeer all have native support for MXP.  Refer to
your MUD client's documentation for information on how to set this up
in your MUD client.

Description
MCCP is the Mud Client Compression Protocol.  This command allows you
to check  whether you are connecting to Discworld using MCCP or not.
Using MCCP reduces  bandwidth use by approximately 20%.  Players
using MCCP should experience  significantly less lag, and will be
given priority in login queues.
This command also displays the total number of people connecting to
Discworld using MCCP.
Examples
>mccp
You are currently using MCCP to connect to Discworld.
Eighty-eight users are currently using MCCP.
>mccp
You are not currently using MCCP to connect to Discworld.  Please read

Description
Lag when you are mudding can be very frustrating.  Whether it's due
to a slow modem, your ISP, or lag at Discworld's end, it can cause a
number of small four letter words to appear from even the most
saintly player.
To help alleviate this, Discworld MUD supports MCCP.
What is MCCP?
MCCP stands for Mud Client Compression Protocol.  It compresses data
in between your MUD client and the Discworld MUD server so that more
data can be sent to your computer in less time.  This can cause a
significant speed increase, and the effect is immediately noticeable.
How can you use MCCP?
A number of MUD clients have built in support for MCCP.  MUSHclient,
zMUD 6 and mcl all have native support for MCCP.  Refer to your MUD
client's documentation for information on how to set this up in your
MUD client
What about other clients?
You can download tinyfugue source code with mccp extensions.
http://discworld.atuin.net/external/taffyd/tf-40s1-mccp.zip
For a more comprehensive listing of clients that have built in MCCP
support, see the For More Information section at the bottom of the
page.
What if my client's MCCP implementation doesn't work with Discworld?
Some versions of zMUD 6 experience problems when reconnecting to
Discworld using MCCP.  This can cause a screen full of garbage text,
disconnections or cause zMUD to crash.  This is a bug in zMUD and you
should download an updated version from the zMUD home page.  You can
also use mcclient to get around this (see below).
How do I know if I'm connected with MCCP or not?
There is a command for this, just simply type "mccp" (without the
quotes) and it will tell you if you're connected with it or not.
I use GMud, zMUD 4.62, how can I use MCCP?
A small program called mcclient can be used to compress connections
to Discworld through any MUD client.  Just download one of the
following files and then follow the installation documentation.
http://mccp.afkmud.com/mcclient-0.4.zip (includes Windows binary and
Windows/Linux source code)
Installing mcclient (Win32)
mcclient is a server application.  You define a list of machines that
you want to connect to in mcclient.cfg, and when the application runs
it creates a compressed socket connection from your machine to the
target machine.
Here are some step-by-step instructions.  Thanks to Kaos for the
initial (and er very Witchy) version of this.
1. Download the mcclient binary package.
2. Extract it using a Zip file expander, like WinZip
3. Save the contents of the archive in a directory. eg: C:\Program
Files\mcclient
4. Download a mcclient.cfg file to use with mcclient
(http://discworld.atuin.net/lpc/mccp/mcclient.cfg), and save it in the
same directory as the mcclient program.  This file will listen for
connections on port 4242 of your machine, and then connect to
discworld.atuin.net on port 23.
5. Run the mcclient.exe application in the win32 folder.  If you make a
shortcut to the exe file, make sure that the Working Directory is
correctly set to C:\Program Files\mcclient.  If your settings are
correct, a DOS box will pop up with the following text:
mcclient: initialising
Local port 4242 redirects to remote host [82.68.167.69]
discworld.atuin.net:23
Now accepting connections.
6. If it doesn't load up, try another port.  On Windows machines most
ports over 1024 are free.  If you open up mcclient.cfg in a text
editor, you can change the port number to any one you want.
7. To use mcclient, you need to open up your MUD client and create a new
connection.  Call this one "Discworld with MCCP" or something similar.
Then you need to set up your connection with the following data:
Host name: localhost (or 127.0.0.1)
Port: 4242 (or whatever you specified in mcclient.cfg)
Then just connect, and your MUD client will connect to the mcclient
application.  Your connection will then be redirected to the Discworld
MUD server, with mccp compression.
8. A few statistics will be displayed to the mcclient screen, you can
just minimize it if you don't want it to take up room on the screen.
Make sure you don't close it by mistake, or your MUD connection will
drop.
9. After you disconnect from the MUD, you can terminate the mcclient
application by hitting Control-C.
Questions regarding MCCP or mcclient can be mudmailed or emailed to
our MCCP support volunteers, Taffyd or Wyvyrn.

coverage unprotected
Description
This command lets you know how much of your body you have protected.
With no arguments, the command will only check armour and clothing
that you are wearing.  If you supply a list of body parts, the
command will tell you what, if anything, is protecting those bits.
You can also check which areas of your body would be covered by
selected items by specifying the items as arguments.  Finally, the
"unprotected" syntax will let you know which of your bits are
flapping in the breeze.
You can also check coverage on someone else in the same room, but
they will be informed that you are doing so.

temperature                  Discworld player help                  temperature
Description
On Discworld it is possible to get hypothermia and heatstroke if you
wear the wrong clothing in the wrong place.  Clearly such a system
could be intensely annoying and so the Discworld system is very
"gentle".  The effects are far less than you would find in the real
world. Ultimately, of course, you can die from both these conditions,
however it would take significant time to get yourself hot enough or
cold enough for such an eventuality.
Managing your temperature
As you start to get too hot or too cold you will begin to sweat or
shiver. If you are getting really, really hot or cold you may
temporarily lose some stat points.
If you are getting cold, put on more clothing. If you are getting too
hot  remove some clothing.
You may also find items, spells or rituals that assist in keeping you
comfortable.
Being wet (through sweating or swimming) will help to cool you down.
The command 'temperature' will tell you how warm the place you are in
is, how much warmth/cooling your clothing is giving you, and how hot
or cold you are.
>
temperature

Your colourful sash is having little or no effect.
Overall, your clothing provides no warmth.
On balance, you are quite comfortable and will stay pretty much as you are.

Name
money - Show how much cash you are carrying
Syntax
money
money <area name>
money <area name> brief
money brief
Description
This command shows you how much money you are carrying.  When used
with no arguments, the command shows all types of money.  If an area
name is given, only money of that type will be displayed.  The
"provincial" money (ie brass, copper, silver, gold, platinum) is
always displayed.  If you ONLY want these types, use "money default".
Note
In the past there have been bugs when money is put in containers, and
it should not be considered as safe as using banks.  Money stored in
vaults will in general not be replaced if it is lost due to bugs.
Example
> money
Your purse contains one Ankh-Morpork dollar, one brass coin and 10 Lancre
crowns.
> money lancre
Your purse contains one brass coin and 10 Lancre crowns.
