[2025-03-16 14:27:23] [server] Welcome to Discworld: the stuff of which dreams are made.
[2025-03-16 14:27:23] [server] Silently, slowly and surely, Great A'Tuin paddles through space, its
[2025-03-16 14:27:23] [server] great eyes surveying the dark, empty wastes before and behind it.
[2025-03-16 14:27:23] [server] Standing on A'Tuin's great back are four enormous elephants, straining
[2025-03-16 14:27:23] [server] under the colossal weight of the Discworld itself.  It sparkles with
[2025-03-16 14:27:23] [server] magic, reflects the light of the stars and generally fails to be as
[2025-03-16 14:27:23] [server] unobtrusive as possible.
[2025-03-16 14:27:23] [server] A large, floppy, black hat recedes into the distance, somehow looking
[2025-03-16 14:27:23] [server] satisfied at what it has left behind.

[2025-03-16 14:27:32] [server] Advice on choosing a name:
[2025-03-16 14:27:32] [server] * Do NOT choose a NAME that is offensive, abusive or profane.
[2025-03-16 14:27:32] [server] * Do not choose a name from the books OR a name that is similar to a
[2025-03-16 14:27:32] [server] character from the books or the MUD.
[2025-03-16 14:27:32] [server] * Do not choose a name that is a NOUN (animal, place, thing, substance,
[2025-03-16 14:27:32] [server] etc.) since this is likely to cause conflicts.
[2025-03-16 14:27:32] [server] Enter the name you wish to play on Discworld or 'g' for a list of
[2025-03-16 14:27:32] [server] generated names:

[2025-03-16 14:27:46] [server] Advice on choosing a password:
[2025-03-16 14:27:46] [server] * Please choose a password that you will remember but that will be hard
[2025-03-16 14:27:46] [server] for others to guess -- your SO's name is NOT a good choice. :-)
[2025-03-16 14:27:46] [server] * Do not share your password with anyone else.
[2025-03-16 14:27:46] [server] * Anything that happens to your character is your responsibility.

[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] term <terminal type>
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] Term sets your terminal type.  If you experiment with terminal types
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] it is your own fault if your terminal hangs... which it may do if you
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] set a term that is not compatible with your client.
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] Currently supported terms are listed if you type "term" without
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] further arguments.
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] Instead of manually setting a term, you can set your terminal type to
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] 'network', which will cause Discworld to use telnet negotiation to
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] ask your client what its preferred terminal type is.  This is the
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] default (and recommended) setting.
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] Different terminal types support different colours.  Some of the
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] older terminal types do not support colour at all; the terminals
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] ending in -nc attempt to emulate colour using combinations of bold,
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] reverse video and underline attributes.  Most terminal types support
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] at least eight, and usually sixteen colours.  The most common of
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] these terminal types is ansi.
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] Modern mud clients (and also most telnet clients) usually support a
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] wider range of colours.  The most common of these terminal types are
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] xterm256 and mxp.
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] To test whether your terminal is set up correctly, use "colours
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] list".  This should show you a list of different colours.  If some of
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] them are white (or black) when they shouldn't be, your terminal is
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] most likely set to a value not supported by your client.  Note that
[2025-03-16 14:30:11] [server] on ansi terminal, many of those colours look the same.

[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] >
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] What do all these things mean?  Well, they all specify how the
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] command will be parsed.  The things inside '<' and '>' are special
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] matching specifiers.  They can be one of the following below:
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] object              Any object in your
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] inventory or on the
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] ground.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] any-living          Any living person
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] anywhere in the game,
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] this allows you to deal
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] with people not in the
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] same room with you.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] distant-living      Any living object that
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] is not in the same room
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] as you.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] living              Any living person in the
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] same room with you.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] preposition         A preposition is a sort
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] of joining word.  They
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] are things like 'on',
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] 'from', 'under', just
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] put in what feels most
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] comfortable to you.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] string              A collection of words.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] Will match 1 or more
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] words.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] word                A single word.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] number              A number, the number
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] must be in numerical
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] format.  It does not
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] handle numbers as words
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] (currently).
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] fraction            A special sort of
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] number, it is specified
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] as something like 12/2,
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] or whatever.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] If the words are enclosed in '{' and '}' then it is a list of
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] required words.  For instance if there was a {bing|red|blue} in the
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] pattern string, then the pattern would match either bing, red or blue
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] in that place.  One of these words MUST be there for the pattern to
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] match.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] If the words are enclosed in '[' and ']' then it is a list of
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] optional words.  It is parsed the same as the list above, except this
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] parameter is optional and you do not need to fill it in.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] Inside the '[', ']' something may be specified in '<', '>'.  They
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] have the same meaning as in the '<', '>' table shown above, except
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] they are optional.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] If there is nothing enclosing the words.  Then they are required
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] parameter and they must be typed in as shown.
[2025-03-16 14:31:36] [server] Good luck! - Pinkfish.

[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Discworld features a rich and sophisticated help system.  Information
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] is available on a wide variety of topics and is accessible in many
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] different ways.
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Concept Help
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Typing "help" by itself or "help concepts" will provide a list of
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Discworld concepts.  An individual concept can be accessed by typing
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] "help <concept>".
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Each concept covers a high-level feature of Discworld and will
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] typically refer to any commands or related concepts for further
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] information.
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Command Help
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Discworld features a wide range of commands.  Some are available all
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] the time while others may be specific to a location or item.  The
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] general commands can be listed using "help command_list" and the
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] details of a particular command can be viewed using "help <topic>".
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Spells, rituals and souls also have their own help which you can read
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] with "help <spell|ritual|soul>".
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Occasionally there may be a clash between two help topics.  To get
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] help explicitly on a spell, ritual, soul or command when there is a
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] clash, you can put "spell", "ritual", "soul" or "command" in front of
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] the name.  e.g. "help spell calm".
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Context Sensitive Help
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] A new feature that is being added to Discworld is the ability for
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] objects and places to have their own help.  To access this
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] information use "help here" or "help <object>".  These pages will
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] provide information about the specific location or object.  e.g.:
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] typing "help here" in a shop will show the help page for shops and
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] provide information on how to use a shop.
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Help System Features
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] The Discworld help system has a number of advanced features to help
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] you find the right files.
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Discworld has an extensive list of synonyms.  e.g.: help fighters
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] will show the guilds concept help file.  In addition if there is no
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] help file for the subject you request Discworld uses a spellcheck
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] algorithm to try to identify help files that might be relevant.
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Caveats
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] Note that the help is being written and maintained by overworked and
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] stressed creators, so errors may slip in, or things may change
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] without being reflected in the help.  If you notice something like
[2025-03-16 14:31:52] [server] this, please report the error with the "bug help <name>" command.

[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] Usercolour                   Discworld player help                   Usercolour
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] Usercolour can be used in titles set with a title changer, the
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] Scolorid's Scintillating Scribbling spell, tricks, illusions, and
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] some other user input.  This file explains how to embed usercolour
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] sequences in text.  Other players will only see usercolour if they
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] enable the relevant output option and have a suitable terminal type
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] defined.
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] Usercolour sequences use a two character code of the percent
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] character '%' followed by the caret character '^' (%^) to signal to the
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] mud that it should generate coloured output.  This two character code
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] is then combined with usercolour options to indicate that the
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] following text should be coloured, or with "reset" to reset coloured
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] output.
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] A usercolour sequence contains of one or more usercolour options,
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] preceded, separated and followed by the %^ character pair.  Options
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] include foreground and background colours, bold, underline and blink.
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] The general form is %^OPTION%^, then some text, then %^RESET%^.  There
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] must be no
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] spaces in usercolour sequences.  Using a reset after the coloured
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] text is essential to turn off the coloured output.
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] An Example
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] The following paragraph contains the text "%^BOLD%^RED%^This is bold red
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] text.%^RESET%^".
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] This is bold red text.
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] Colours, backgrounds, modifiers and reset must be entered in upper
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] case.  In general it does not matter which order you list a
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] combination of foreground, background and modifiers.  When combining
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] multiple usercolour options, a single %^ code between options is
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] sufficient.
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] If you wish to turn off an option, you need to use a reset and then
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] re-activate all the otions you wish to remain active.  For example
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] %^BOLD%^RED%^Librarian: %^RESET%^RED%^Not a monkey!%^RESET%^ generates the
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] text: Librarian: Not a monkey!
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] The Available Colours Etc.
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] Options available for colours are: red, magenta, orange, yellow,
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] green, blue, cyan, white and black.  Options for background colours
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] are: b_red, b_magenta, etc.  Additional modifiers are: bold, flash
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] and underline. Some of these colours may not be supported depending
[2025-03-16 14:32:25] [server] on your terminal type.

[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] Discworld allows you to customise the colours in which various kinds
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] of texts are displayed.  This is done primarily through the "options"
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] system.
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] To see your current colour settings, use "options colour"; further
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] colour settings are in "options colour club" (for individual club
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] channels), "options colour inform" (for informs you have enabled
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] using the "inform" command), and so on.
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] To change a colour setting, use: "options colour <event> = <colour>".
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] This will set all future messages of type <event> to be displayed in
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] the colour <colour>.  Instead of a colour, you can set the value to
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] "default" to let the game choose a colour for messages of the given
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] type), or "none" to have them displayed without colour.
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] The colour settings for talker channels are tied to the object you
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] use as a talker (so you will have to set them again if you replace
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] your talker).  To enable colour on your talker, use "talker colour
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] on".  To see the colour settings for your talker, use "talker colour
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] list".  To change the colour for a channel, use "talker colour
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] <channel> <colour>".
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] The Basic Colours
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] Depending on your client and terminal type, there are many colour
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] options available.  The eight basic colours which nearly all clients
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] support are:
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] red
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] magenta
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] icterine
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] green
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] blue
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] cyan
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] white (white)
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] black (black)
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] Additional modifiers (which MUD clients often do not fully support)
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] are:
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] bold
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] italic
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] flash
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] underline
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] Modifiers and colours can be combined, giving for instance bold red
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] or italic underline cyan.  For historical reasons, the colour yellow
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] is simply an alias for bold icterine.
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] In addition, most clients allow the use of background colours.  These
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] can be addressed as b_red, b_magenta and so on.  Background colours
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] cannot be made bold.
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] Further Colours
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] Most modern clients have more extensive colour support.  For these
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] clients, we have added some further colours, for example: lightblue,
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] lightyellow, darkgreen, darkcyan, deepmagenta, deepwhite and so on,
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] orange, rose, chartreuse, violet, azure, springgreen, grey, gold,
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] silver, copper, bronze, brass, purple, pink, brown, khaki, ecru,
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] beige, jade, turquoise, olive, lilac, mint, vermilion, sage,
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] goldenrod, lime, teal, maroon, aquamarine, orchid, puce, topaz,
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] emerald, cobalt, crimson, and many more.  The complete list of
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] available colour names can be found in the helpfile:
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] help colour list
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] In addition, you can use hexadecimal codes, for example #FFBF00 or
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] B_#004225.
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] (NOTE: if these colours just look like the basic eight and their bold
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] versions to you, you are most likely on term ansi.  Sometimes players
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] have this setting even when their client also supports more colours;
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] try setting "term network" to let your client inform us of its
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] preferences.)

[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] Extras
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] Players can also set colours in titles set with a title changer,
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] tricks, their refer and some other user input.  This is explained in:
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] help usercolour
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] To see any such user set colours (including your own!) that do not go
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] through the options or talker colour control, use the options output
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] usercolour option.
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] > options output usercolour=on
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] The final colour codes to mention are: ansired, ansigreen,
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] ansiyellow, ansibold, ansiitalic, b_ansiblue, b_ansimagenta and so on
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] (but only for the ansi colours and the modifiers), as well as
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] ansireset.  These "colours" are used as overrides: they are ignored
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] on a terminal with 256 or more colours, but have the expected value
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] on ansi terminals.  This may be used by players who usually play from
[2025-03-16 14:32:33] [server] a client with extensive colour support, but occasionally swap to an
[2025-03-16 14:32:34] [server] alternative which only supports term ansi.
[2025-03-16 14:32:34] [server] For example, the colour azure is normally displayed as cyan on an
[2025-03-16 14:32:34] [server] ansi terminal.  The alternative colour group azure ansiblue ansibold
[2025-03-16 14:32:34] [server] is displayed as azure when viewed on a client with 256-colour
[2025-03-16 14:32:34] [server] support, but as bold blue when using term ansi.
[2025-03-16 14:32:34] [server] To see how a colour will look: use "colours test <colour>".  To see
[2025-03-16 14:32:34] [server] how it will look on an ansi- or xterm256-terminal, use "colours test
[2025-03-16 14:32:34] [server] ansi <colour>" or "colours test xterm <colour>" respectively.  For
[2025-03-16 14:32:34] [server] example:
[2025-03-16 14:32:34] [server] > colours test azure ansiblue ansibold
[2025-03-16 14:32:34] [server] > colours test ansi azure ansiblue ansibold

[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] This helpfile lists all the colours which are available in Discworld
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] by name.  These colours can be used both as foreground colours and
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] background colours, as described in help colours.
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Aside from these named colours, you can address any colour with its
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] hexadecimal RGB-code, e.g. #FFE5B4 or B_#FFE5B4.
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Terminal Settings
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Most players have one of the following three terminal settings:
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] ANSI:     these players have only the basic eight
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] colours and their eight bold versions, so
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] the first sixteen listed below.  All other
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] colours will be translated to these sixteen
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] options.
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] XTERM256: these players have access to the basic
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] eight, their eight bold versions, 216
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] "mixed" colours and 24 further shades of
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] grey.  The colour names below are chosen
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] exactly to name these 256 colours.  Colours
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] specified using a #-code (such as #FFE5B4)
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] are translated to the nearest match.
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] MXP:      (or XTERM16m) these players have access to
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] full 24-bit colour support.  No translations
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] are necessary.
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] If many of the colours in this file look the same to you, then you
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] are probably set to term ansi.  It may be worth using "term network"
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] to let your client renegotiate the terminal settings it supports.
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Note
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] To view this list as intended, you should have your cols value set to
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] at least 80.  If your window is not large enough for this, you can
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] still list all the colours using "colours list".
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Basic Colours
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] The eight basic colours are:
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Black    Red      Green    Icterine Blue     Magenta  Cyan     White
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] The way these colours are displayed is likely to vary wildly between
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] MUD clients, and often can be altered by a change in the settings.
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] The same holds for the bold versions of these colours: Bold Black,
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Bold Red, Bold Green, Bold Icterine, Bold Blue, Bold Magenta, Bold
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Cyan, Bold White.  Note that bold colours cannot be used as
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] background-colour, and that some clients may display them in a bold
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] font, while others may only show a brighter colour.
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] A ninth basic colour is        Yellow.  This colour is often an alias
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] for bold icterine, but is displayed as a separate colour on
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] mxp-compatible terminals.
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Colour List
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] The remaining colours are unlikely to differ much between clients,
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] but are not supported on term ansi (where they are instead translated
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] to the basic 16 options).
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Note that some of the colours currently do not have a good name
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] assigned.  If you have good suggestions, please ideareport them on
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] the colours command.  Even if names are added, the given hexadecimal
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] codes will continue to work.

[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Recommended Colours
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] To ease the job of finding a good set of visually distinct colours,
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] we highlight a set of (mostly) rather different colours:
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] The dark, deep and light variations of the primary and secondary
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] colours: DarkRed, DeepRed, LightRed, DarkMagenta, DeepMagenta,
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] LightMagenta, DarkBlue, DeepBlue, LightBlue, DarkCyan, DeepCyan,
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] LightCyan, DarkGreen, DeepGreen, LightGreen, DarkYellow, DeepYellow,
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] LightYellow.
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Three shades each of the tertiary colours: Brown, Orange, Saffron,
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Flirt, Rose, HotPink, Indigo, Violet, Hyacinth, Cobalt, Azure,
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] SkyBlue, Jade, SpringGreen, Chrysophrase, Avocado, Chartreuse,
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] Pistachio,
[2025-03-16 14:32:42] [server] The lightest six colours: Bisque, Magnolia, Periwinkle, Bubbles,

[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] Name
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] parser - the Discworld object parser
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] The Discworld object parser allows you to interact with objects in
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] many different ways.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] So if you have a blue frog in your inventory, you can type 'look at
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] frog' or 'look at blue frog'.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] If you have several types of the same object, you can refer to it
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] with a number or an ordinal.  For example, 'blue frog 1' or '3rd blue
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] frog'.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] You can refer to several types of the same object by specifying the
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] number of objects you want to use.  For example, '1 blue frog' or
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] 'twenty blue frogs'.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] You can also interact with objects in containers by using 'in'.  For
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] example, 'look at beer in bottle'.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] You can interact with several things at once by using ',' and '&'.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] Typing 'look at frog,womble' will allow you to look at both objects,
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] but only if both objects are present.  Typing 'look at frog & womble'
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] however, will allow you to look at the frog even if the womble isn't
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] present and vice versa.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] If you only want to interact with objects that lie in the room, then
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] you can use 'here'.  For example, 'look at green bottle here' If you
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] only want to interact with objects that lie in your inventory then
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] you can use 'my'.  For example, 'look at my shoes'.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] You can also specify random objects to match from a group with the
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] 'random' keyword.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] You can reference all items with 'every', e.g. 'take every coin from
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] corpse'.  You can also reference everything except something else,
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] e.g. 'take every coin except coin 1'.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] Living things can be specified with the 'living' keyword.  This
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] allows you to reference living things without referencing non-living
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] things.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] The mud remembers what you last referenced, so you can reference them
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] again with 'it', 'them', 'him', 'her' keywords.  If for example, you
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] have just looked at somebody and want to look at her socks you can
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] type 'look socks on her'.  If you have just looked at a cabbage, you
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] can pick it up with 'get it', and so on.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] You can change how precisely you want to target stuff with the option
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] 'input ambiguous'.  If you are a complete control freak who always
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] wants to specify precisely which object you are referring to then try
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] setting 'options input ambiguous = on', otherwise leaving it 'off'
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] might be better.  This means that you can omit certain bits of an
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] item's specification when you do something to it.  E.g. You have
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] three candles.  You want to light one.  Having the option 'on' you
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] cannot do 'light candle' (would result in a parser error), having it
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] 'off' you can.  Having it on you would have to use either 'light
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] candle 1', 'light candle 2', or 'light candle 3'.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] It is also possible to turn on and off the processing of 'and' as a
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] break word or as (part of) an adjective.  If you use 'options input
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] andascomma = on' you will turn on the possibility to use 'and' as if
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] it was a comma.  If you turn this to off then you can use it as part
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] of an adjective and reference things like 'red and blue jacket'.
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] The 'shorthand' option will expand things like 'u' to 'you' if you
[2025-03-16 14:33:19] [server] set it to 'on'.

[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] identify <object(s)>
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] This command can be used to describe an object in your inventory with
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] a word/words you choose yourself.  Items that have had an indicator
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] specified by you are shown as such by "locate".  An item's identifier
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] is preserved over logins; it will only be removed or changed through
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] the use of the identify or unindentify commands.
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] Note: Leaving your inventory does not affect the identifier.
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] The 'identify <object>' syntax will show the current identifier (if
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] any) for the object.
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] The 'identify claim <object>' syntax will transfer an identifier
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] someone else set to you.
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] Special identifiers
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] "component pouch" is checked for components needed for casting spells
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] and performing rituals.  "medicine bag" is checked for bandages for
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] the bandage command.
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] Objects you have identified have the "identified" adjective and
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] objects you have not identified have the "unidentified" adjective.

[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] only have a single identification.
[2025-03-16 14:33:34] [server] Example:

[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] Welcome to the Help Hut!  This room contains some basic information
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] on how to get help and what to do now.  Be sure to read to the end!
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] Note: To browse through a lengthy help file, type "f" to move forward
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] (or just send an empty line), or type "q" to exit it completely.
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] Getting Help
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] Here is a list of ways to get help.  You don't have to try them all
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] now, but it would be good to note them down somewhere, as you will
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] probably need them later!
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] - While you're under 18 hours old, you have the newbie channel.
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] Use the newbie command to talk on it, for example "newbie
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] Hello!".
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] - Type "help here" to see what you can do in any given room.
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] This works in all the rooms in the newbie area, and most of
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] the rooms in game where there is something you can do (like
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] shops).
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] - For a list of basic commands, use "help essentials".
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] - In the newbie area, all rooms can teach you something.  If you
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] want to know more, type "tutorial".  This gives some
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] background information.
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] Look
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] A command you will regularly use is "look".  On its own, this will
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] show the room you're in.  With an argument, like "look cot", you can
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] look at things in the room or your inventory.  Often descriptions
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] give an indication of how to work with an item or NPC (non-player
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] character).  Try it out!  (first just "look", then "look cot")
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] Hints
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] In the introduction and Pumpkin Town, you sometimes get HINTs how to
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] do things.  These little tidbits of help will only appear inside the
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] newbie area, so don't get too used to them!  You can turn them off if
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] you want.
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] Introduction Rooms
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] Before going into the game, you are advised to follow the
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] introduction.  To start, after playing with the look command, simply
[2025-03-16 14:33:50] [server] type "south".

[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] Combat - Settling arguments the hard way.
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] During your travels on Discworld, you will sometimes need to defend
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] yourself, or even choose to attack someone (or something).  You may
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] be up against evil rats lusting after your blood, or a mugger who
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] just tried to rob you;  you may end up fighting a duel with knives or
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] taking part in a bar brawl.  Apart from necessity, brutally murdering
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] the locals on your path is a useful tactic to gain some experience
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] for your advancement in the mud.
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] Combat
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] Combat is mostly automatic - you don't have to type commands to
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] attack or defend yourself, your character will do the standard
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] actions on its own.  There are some special commands you can learn,
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] but you don't have to worry about that immediately.
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] While in combat, every few seconds your character has the opportunity
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] to attack (as do all the other combatants).  Whether a combatant
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] takes that opportunity or not depends on how many other actions they
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] have done recently and their combat tactics (also related to the
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] tactics skill & see also the tactics command).
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] The attacks available depend on the weapons the attacker is wielding,
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] and the successful use of each attack depends on the attacker's bonus
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] in the relevant skill for that weapon, the defender's skill, the
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] weapon itself and some other factors.
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] If the target is hit, some of the damage may be absorbed by the
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] target's armour and the rest of it will damage the opponent (his
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] hitpoints go down).  Once your hitpoints reach 0, you die.
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] Skills
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] Your ability to fight is determined by a set of skills and the way in
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] which you fight is determined by your tactics.  You can see your
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] skills with "skills fighting".

[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] Stopping combat
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] You will continue to fight against all of your attackers even if you
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] leave the room and come back.  Both combatants must use the "stop"
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] command to end hostilities.
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] Useful commands
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] There are a lot of tactics you can use in combat, and commands that
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] can help you.  Most of this you will have to learn for yourself, by
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] experimenting.  Nevertheless, here are some commands that you might
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] find useful.  Each of these has its own helpfile - for example "help
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] wimpy".
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] consider - shows how good your target is; always use before attacking!
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] wimpy - allows you to run away when badly damaged
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] monitor - shows brief score updates during combat
[2025-03-16 14:33:56] [server] tactics - changes your character's fighting methods/attitude

[2025-03-16 14:34:02] [server] kill <thing>
[2025-03-16 14:34:02] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:34:02] [server] Kill is the command used to initiate combat with monsters and other
[2025-03-16 14:34:02] [server] players.  Once combat has started, you will hit the monsters
[2025-03-16 14:34:02] [server] automatically and be able to use commands and spells given to you by
[2025-03-16 14:34:02] [server] your guild.  If a monster starts a fight with you, there is probably
[2025-03-16 14:34:02] [server] little you can do other than kill it or run for your life.
[2025-03-16 14:34:02] [server] A trick that is useful when referencing living things is to use the
[2025-03-16 14:34:02] [server] 'living' adjective.  This will make sure you reference the living
[2025-03-16 14:34:02] [server] troll and not the corpse of the troll on the ground in front of you.
[2025-03-16 14:34:02] [server] Example

[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] consider - Consider how worthwhile it is to attack something.
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] Syntax
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] consider <target(s)>
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] The consider command can be used to see if the monster you are
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] thinking about attacking is too high or too low a level for you.
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] This command is provided as is without any warranty express or
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] implied.  Your mileage may vary.
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] You can also try to consider an opponent covertly. This will give you
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] the same information as a normal consider, but will not notify your
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] opponent that they have been considered if the check against
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] covert.casing.person is successful.
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] Responses
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] The following are the order of responses that `consider' gives:
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] <target> is too weak to bother attacking
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] <target> is someone you look down on
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] <target> would be an easy target
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] <target> is a lot weaker than you are
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] <target> is weaker than you are
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] <target> is slightly weaker than you are
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] <target> is about equal with you
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] <target> is slightly tougher than you are
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] <target> is tougher than you
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] <target> is a lot tougher than you
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] <target> looks pretty nasty
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] <target> is into the don't think about it region
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] You would have to be utterly insane to attack <target>
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] Caveats
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] 'consider' takes into account such things as weapon, armour,
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] offensive and defensive skill and hit points so your results may vary
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] depending on the health and equipment of the monsters at the time.
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] 'consider' does not take into account any special tactics, commands,
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] rituals or spells which may be employed by you or your opponents.
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] At high levels (for both players and NPCs) consider becomes more and
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] more inaccurate.
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] If you consider multiple targets it will attempt to calculate your
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] chances against all the monsters at once - but it's only a rough
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] guide.
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] Examples
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] > consider dragon
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] You would have to be utterly insane to attack the dragon!
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] > consider rat
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] The rat would be an easy target.
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] >consider covert merchant
[2025-03-16 14:34:22] [server] The merchant, considered covertly, is a lot tougher than you.

[2025-03-16 14:35:13] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:35:13] [server] You can set the percentage of your hit points at which you run away.
[2025-03-16 14:35:13] [server] If you have set the number to zero you are in brave mode and won't

[2025-03-16 14:35:13] [server] Caveats
[2025-03-16 14:35:13] [server] While wimpy is very effective and will generally get you out of harms
[2025-03-16 14:35:13] [server] way this is not guaranteed.  Even with wimpy you can still die!
[2025-03-16 14:35:13] [server] Your wimpy setting has a small effect on your XP: the higher your
[2025-03-16 14:35:13] [server] wimpy is set, the less xp you gain per kill.
[2025-03-16 14:35:13] [server] Because wimpy stops combat, it's generally a good idea to set it to
[2025-03-16 14:35:13] [server] zero when engaged in a PK fight.  If you wimpy during a PK fight, and
[2025-03-16 14:35:13] [server] then some lingering effect of the combat kills you, you will lose a
[2025-03-16 14:35:13] [server] real life because you will no longer be in combat with a player.

[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] Score gives you an indication of your current condition.  Choosing
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] "brief" will give you the short version, while "verbose" will give
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] you the longer; if you don't specify, it defaults to your current
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] mode.  The option "stats" will cause your stats to be shown, rather
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] than your general score information.  All of these horrible numbers
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] are used all over the place to calculate your general well-being.
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] You can also gloat over your achievements with the "quests" option
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] and check your alignment with the "align" option.
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] The "score quests sorted" command displays your quests in an
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] alphabetically sorted list.
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] You can use the "score relationships" command to show your
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] relationship to other members of your family.  You cannot use this if
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] you are not in a family, and if you want more information such as
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] inter-family relationships then you will have to use the "finger"
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] command.
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] The "score fighting" command shows which NPCs or players you are
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] currently fighting. (If any.)
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] "score temperature" shows how warm (or cool) you are, and what
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] contributes to that, while "score burden" tells you how burdened you
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] are.
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] You can use the command "gp" to show your current distribution of
[2025-03-16 14:35:59] [server] guild points.

[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] Monitor is a hit point monitor that goes on during combat.  This
[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] tells you the current state of your hit points and guild points.
[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] "monitor" by itself will show the current monitor status (i.e. off or
[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] on), and "monitor show" will show what it looks like when it fires..
[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] It is also possible to customise your monitor.  To do this use the
[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] "monitor <string>" syntax with the string you want displayed.
[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] Certain control codes will be replaced in your string.  These are:
[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] $hp$                Your current amount of hit points.
[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] $maxhp$             Your maximum amount of hit points.

[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] This is "$hurtcolour$You are $hp_rp$ and $gp_rp$.$reset$" if you are
[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] in roleplaying mode, and "$hurtcolour$Hp: $hp$ ($maxhp$) Gp: $gp$
[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] ($maxgp$) Xp: $xp$$reset$" if you're not.  If you set a custom
[2025-03-16 14:36:27] [server] monitor, it will be used regardless of roleplaying status.

[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] When it comes to applying your knowledge, in the form of your levels
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] in the various skills, it is very often the case that your bonus in a
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] skill is used, rather than your level.  The bonus provides a much
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] more relevant measure of how good you are at something, since it
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] takes into account your natural ability in the form of your stats.
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] There are five stats, which you may view at any time with "score
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] stats", and they are constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] and wisdom.  Your array of stats forms what wizards term your anima,
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] as opposed to your skills which form your animus.
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Constitution
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Your constitution is a measure of how healthy you are, and is
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] frequently used to determine whether you succumb to disease or
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] poison.  Amongst other skills, it is important for your bonus in
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] "adventuring.health" and hence the number of hit points you have.
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Dexterity
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Your dexterity determines how agile and graceful you are.  It will be
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] used to determine  how you land from a fall and is used in the
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] determination of the bonus for many skills, for example
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] "fighting.defence.dodging", "magic.methods.physical" and, of course,
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] many of the "covert" skills - a good dexterity is a must for any
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] decent thief or assassin.
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Intelligence
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Your intelligence reflects how bright you are and determines how able
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] you are at figuring things out for yourself.  It is the most
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] important stat for bonuses in "magic", so it is very important for
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] wizards and witches, but it also plays a part in such skills as
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] "covert.casing", "faith.items" and a number of the more mental
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] skills, including "people.valuing" and "adventuring.evaluating".
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Strength
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Your strength is a measure of your physical power and build.  Its
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] most obvious role is in determining how much you are able to carry.
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] A fighter will need a good strength as it is the main stat used for
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] calculating "fighting" bonuses, with dexterity not far behind, and is
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] also used for "crafts.smithing.black" and the more physical
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] "adventuring" skills.
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Wisdom
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Your wisdom is a reflection of the power of your intuition and common
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] sense.  It is by far the most important stat for priests, in that it
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] determines bonuses in "faith", and is also used for
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] "magic.methods.spiritual" and a number of the more mental skills,
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] including "adventuring.perception".

[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] All of your stats start out at 13.  Once you have chosen a guild to
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] join, you will probably want to make use of "rearrange" to set your
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] stats appropriately for that guild.  The command lets you set each
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] stat to any value between 8 and 23, so long as the total is still 65
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] or less, and once used, you lose the command, so make sure you do it
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] right as you only get one chance.
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] You do not need to rearrange your stats very early on in the game,
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] spend some time playing with your character getting the feel of how
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] things work and talking to other members of your guild before you
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] make a decision about how you wish to set your stats with the
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] rearrange command.
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Again, you may only rearrange once.
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Changing Stats
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] There are various ways to modify your stats.  The most common way is
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] to change them temporarily, for instance, a ritual or potion might
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] give you more points in one or more stats for a short time.  Another
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] way is through magic items which change your stats indefinitely,
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] although there will always be a price to pay for the change and as
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] soon as you can no longer pay the price, your stats will revert.
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] Just as there are ways to improve your stats, there will be things
[2025-03-16 14:37:04] [server] that reduce them; contracting a disease might reduce your strength,
[2025-03-16 14:37:05] [server] while wearing awkward clothing or heavy armour might lower your
[2025-03-16 14:37:05] [server] dexterity.
[2025-03-16 14:37:05] [server] There may be particular places available in-game, where a service to
[2025-03-16 14:37:05] [server] change your stats is offered, usually for a fee of some kind.  This
[2025-03-16 14:37:05] [server] may allow you to tweak your one or more stats very slightly.
[2025-03-16 14:37:05] [server] Should you ever be unfortunate enough to meet Death, all of your
[2025-03-16 14:37:05] [server] stats will be temporarily lowered, although there are ways to be
[2025-03-16 14:37:05] [server] restored more quickly than by simply waiting.

[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] bonus - The effect of your stats on your skills.
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] Discworld uses a hierarchical skill system.  A player has skills
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] numbering into the hundreds in which they can improve and train; see
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] "help skills" for more.
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] When it comes to using your skills, it is generally your bonus in
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] each skill that is relevant, rather than your level in that skill.
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] Although your bonus in a skill is partly determined by your level in
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] that skill, it is also affected by your stats.  There are five stats
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] - constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength and wisdom.  See
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] "help stats" for more.
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] To view your stats, type "score stats".  To see how a given skill
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] depends on your stats, use the "skills" command, for example "skills
[2025-03-16 14:37:29] [server] magic.points stats".

[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] Discworld uses a hierarchical skill system.  A player has skills
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] numbering into the hundreds in which they can improve and train.
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] The hierarchy of skills
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] Each skill falls into one of seven top-level groups: adventuring,
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] covert, crafts, faith, fighting, magic and people.  Each of these
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] groups is then further subdivided as necessary.
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] For example, magic skills are divided up into magic.spells,
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] magic.methods, magic.items and magic.points.  Next, magic.spells is
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] divided into magic.spells.offensive, magic.spells.defensive,
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] magic.spells.misc and magic.spells.special - none of these skills
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] have subskills, so the subdivision ends there.
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] Viewing your skills
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] To find out what skills you have, use the "skills" command.  Used on
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] its own, this will show you all your skills.  You can also view only
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] a subset of these by using for example "skills magic", "skills
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] magic.spells" and so on.  The output of the skills command will show
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] two numbers associated with each skill.  The first of these is your
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] level and the second is your bonus - see "Using your skills" below
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] for more information on bonuses.
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] Advancing your skills
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] When you start out as a new character, you may not immediately be
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] able to advance the "branch" skills such as magic.spells.misc,
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] because you can only advance skills that you have at least depth*5
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] skill levels in.
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] For example, if you have no magic skills at all, the only thing in
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] the magic skilltree that you will be able to advance is magic itself.
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] Once you have 5 levels of magic, you can start advancing
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] magic.spells.  Once you have 10 levels of magic.spells, you can start
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] advancing magic.spells.offensive.
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] Skill levels can be advanced at your guild, by teaching yourself, or
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] by learning from other players.  If you aren't sure which skills you
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] should advance, you might want to try asking other players on the
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] talker (see "help talker").
[2025-03-16 14:37:38] [server] Using your skills
[2025-03-16 14:37:39] [server] When it comes to using your skills, it is generally your bonus in
[2025-03-16 14:37:39] [server] each skill that is relevant, rather than your level in that skill.
[2025-03-16 14:37:39] [server] Although your bonus in a skill is partly determined by your level in
[2025-03-16 14:37:39] [server] that skill, it is also affected by your stats.  There are five stats
[2025-03-16 14:37:39] [server] - constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength and wisdom.  To
[2025-03-16 14:37:39] [server] view your stats, type "score stats".  To see how a given skill
[2025-03-16 14:37:39] [server] depends on your stats, use the "skills" command, for example "skills

[2025-03-16 14:39:05] [server] The inventory command is used to list the things you are carrying.
[2025-03-16 14:39:05] [server] The list is separated into the things you're holding, the things
[2025-03-16 14:39:05] [server] you're wearing, and the things you're just carrying.  Worn things are
[2025-03-16 14:39:05] [server] further subdivided into items that will show up when someone looks at
[2025-03-16 14:39:05] [server] you, and items that are hidden under other clothing (e.g. underpants
[2025-03-16 14:39:05] [server] are hidden by trousers).
[2025-03-16 14:39:05] [server] The number of items you can have in your inventory is not unlimited -
[2025-03-16 14:39:05] [server] a maximum of ten items can be carried at any time.  If you try to
[2025-03-16 14:39:05] [server] carry more than this, you will fumble the excess.  Kept items (see
[2025-03-16 14:39:05] [server] "help keep") will not be fumbled unless you've already fumbled all
[2025-03-16 14:39:05] [server] your unkept items.

[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] There are a number of combat options that you can set to determine
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] your tactics in a fight - you can change these settings at any time,
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] even during the middle of a fight, to change your tactics.  The first
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] option is your attitude: you can be on the offensive (in which case
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] you get a bonus to attacking, but a penalty to dodging and parrying),
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] or on the defensive (in which case you get a bonus to dodging and
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] parrying, but a penalty to attacking) or you can take a neutral
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] attitude (in which case there are no bonuses or penalties).
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] In dealing with an attack, you can choose your response: you can
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] always dodge or you can always parry or you can be neutral in your
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] response. When using neutral response there is a slight bonus since
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] your opponent doesn't know if you will dodge or parry.
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] For parrying, you can choose whether to always parry with the weapon,
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] or shield, in your left or right hand or always attempt to use the
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] weapons, or weapon and shield, in both hands.
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] If you are fighting unarmed, you can choose to attempt to parry with
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] your arm or hand (this special manoeuvre can be disabling if you are
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] not skillful enough, but would prevent an attack from reaching your
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] more vital areas).
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] You can control your mercy: always accept surrenders, never accept
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] surrenders, or ask whether or not to accept surrenders.
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] Note: Surrendering might not be possible currently.
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] You can focus on a specific part of an opponent's body. While this
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] makes it more difficult to hit the opponent, it may enable you to
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] cause a greater degree of injury if you do get the hit(s) in. With
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] different races the part you have chosen to target will be mapped
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] onto that race's body.
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] It is important to realise that for best results, the tactics that
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] you choose should depend on your armoury, your opponents and the
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] armouries of your opponents - no two fights will ever be quite the
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] same.
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] Note
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] The distance and mercy options are currently disabled, they may be
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] enabled in the future.

[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] Character Profiles
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] Alice the Assassin wears typical assassin's clothing, but carries
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] around rather a lot of the hardware typical to the trade.  After a
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] successful inhumation, she wields a rapier and a dagger and attempts
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] to make good her escape from the scene.  Since she is mostly
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] interested in getting away, she sets her combat attitude to
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] defensive; given the weight of the tools that she carries, she sets
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] her combat response to parry and chooses to always parry with the
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] dagger in her left hand in order to protect her more delicate rapier.
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] Birzig the Barbarian wears the standard leather garment, a cloak made
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] from the wool of Hublandish sheep and a pair of fur-lined boots.  He
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] carries little beyond a small satchel and his trusty bastard sword.
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] Since his goal is to defeat his enemies, he sets his combat attitude
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] to offensive and his response to neutral, since given the little he
[2025-03-16 14:39:16] [server] carries he can either dodge or parry with his bastard sword.

[2025-03-16 14:45:28] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:45:28] [server] The quests command allows you to list quests and show hints, details
[2025-03-16 14:45:28] [server] or solutions for them. Quests can be listed based on their area or
[2025-03-16 14:45:28] [server] whether you have completed them or not.
[2025-03-16 14:45:28] [server] There are four types of hints available for quests: general,
[2025-03-16 14:45:28] [server] location, item and NPC hints. The "quests show
[2025-03-16 14:45:28] [server] {general|location|item|npc} hint for <quest>" syntax will show the
[2025-03-16 14:45:28] [server] first hint of the specified type and the "next" option will show the
[2025-03-16 14:45:28] [server] next hint.
[2025-03-16 14:45:28] [server] If you want more detailed location, item or NPC information the
[2025-03-16 14:45:29] [server] "quests show {solution|location|item|npc} [details] for <quest>"
[2025-03-16 14:45:29] [server] syntax should be used. Note that the "solution" option will show the
[2025-03-16 14:45:29] [server] full solution for the quest.
[2025-03-16 14:45:29] [server] For those who prefer a web interface, the same information can be

[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] Quests are, in essence, puzzles that have been worked into the game.
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] For example, a number centre around finding items and returning them
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] to NPCs - Non-Player Characters, another word for the "monsters" that
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] populate the game.  Others involve figuring out how to get somewhere,
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] or how to do a particular thing. Sometimes completing a quest even
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] gives you a neat reward!
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] Now comes the important part of this help file: There is a webpage
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] with hints and full solutions located at:
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] http://discworld.atuin.net/lpc/secure/quests.c
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] Note that some players get a lot of satisfaction by completing the
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] quests by themselves.  If you discuss how to solve a quest on a
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] public channel or by shouting it, you're probably ruining the
[2025-03-16 14:45:37] [server] experience for many others.  If you're desperate you can ask another
[2025-03-16 14:45:38] [server] player in a "tell" for some kind of additional hint or insight.
[2025-03-16 14:45:38] [server] I repeat:  Quests are not for discussion on any public channel.

[2025-03-16 14:45:51] [server] The default behaviour of the command is to print out the details in
[2025-03-16 14:45:51] [server] an area based output.  An area based output groups all the commands
[2025-03-16 14:45:51] [server] into various areas and then prints them out based on that area.  If
[2025-03-16 14:45:51] [server] you show the commands combined it shows them all in one group.

[2025-03-16 14:48:50] [server] Headcrusher says: Any warrior worth his salt uses a warcry.  A warcry serves to

[2025-03-16 14:48:50] [server] as effectively.

[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] Called as you are to a life of dedicated slaughter, you have come to
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] realise that you are destined for some special task, either as a
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] result of Fate, or others of the gods, or some unfinished labour of
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] your ancestors.  Whatever the nature of this geas laid upon you, you
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] have discovered that it has given you the ability to dismay an
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] opponent in battle with a loud warcry.  Before joining combat,
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] therefore, issue the command "warcry" or "warcry <words>".
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] A warcry will take 10 fighting points to prepare and another 10 when
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] combat starts. Your bonus in fighting.special.tactics is tested
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] against your opponent's bonus for the same skill.
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] Since you don't want to use a whole lungful of breath just before
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] battle, your warcry should be short and precise.
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] A ".warcries" alias can be used with "warcry random" to issue a
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] random warcry.  In the alias, each warcry should be separated with a
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] ";".
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] Example
[2025-03-16 14:49:12] [server] > warcry Onward with the Cabbage!

[2025-03-16 14:49:32] [server] which is available in the weapons and armour shop here, it's possible to
[2025-03-16 14:49:32] [server] impale your opponent.  This special combat manoeuvre does much more damage
[2025-03-16 14:49:32] [server] than regular combat, but takes a bit of skill to pull off.
[2025-03-16 14:49:38] [server] Headcrusher says: If you're worried about the money for buying a spear, you can
[2025-03-16 14:49:38] [server] sell it to the general store afterwards.  They'll give you most of what
[2025-03-16 14:49:38] [server] it's worth, although you'll still lose a bit.

[2025-03-16 14:49:42] [server] Hint: Make sure you have purchased a spear (in the weapons and armour shop up

[2025-03-16 14:51:00] [server] with no arguments, the command shows all types of money.  If an area
[2025-03-16 14:51:00] [server] name is given, only money of that type will be displayed.  The
[2025-03-16 14:51:00] [server] "provincial" money (ie brass, copper, silver, gold, platinum) is
[2025-03-16 14:51:00] [server] always displayed.  If you ONLY want these types, use "money default".
[2025-03-16 14:51:00] [server] Note
[2025-03-16 14:51:00] [server] In the past there have been bugs when money is put in containers, and
[2025-03-16 14:51:00] [server] it should not be considered as safe as using banks.  Money stored in
[2025-03-16 14:51:00] [server] vaults will in general not be replaced if it is lost due to bugs.

[2025-03-16 14:51:22] [server] This command lets you hold weapons, shields and other things like
[2025-03-16 14:51:22] [server] torches, which need a hand to be useful.  There is no need for
[2025-03-16 14:51:22] [server] wielding weapons as holding them basically does this.  You can wield
[2025-03-16 14:51:22] [server] two weapons, one in each hand.
[2025-03-16 14:51:22] [server] You can also use this command to hold shields in specific hands.  If
[2025-03-16 14:51:22] [server] you wear a shield it will use any free limbs you have.
[2025-03-16 14:51:22] [server] Some weapons can be held in both hands at once.  By default these
[2025-03-16 14:51:22] [server] weapons will use both hands, to hold them in a single hand indicate
[2025-03-16 14:51:22] [server] which hand you want the weapon held in.  You can also specify which
[2025-03-16 14:51:22] [server] two hands you want the weapon held in, if it is a multi-handed
[2025-03-16 14:51:23] [server] weapon.

[2025-03-16 14:52:21] [server] Kill is the command used to initiate combat with monsters and other
[2025-03-16 14:52:21] [server] players.  Once combat has started, you will hit the monsters
[2025-03-16 14:52:21] [server] automatically and be able to use commands and spells given to you by
[2025-03-16 14:52:21] [server] your guild.  If a monster starts a fight with you, there is probably
[2025-03-16 14:52:21] [server] little you can do other than kill it or run for your life.
[2025-03-16 14:52:21] [server] A trick that is useful when referencing living things is to use the
[2025-03-16 14:52:21] [server] 'living' adjective.  This will make sure you reference the living
[2025-03-16 14:52:21] [server] troll and not the corpse of the troll on the ground in front of you.

[2025-03-16 14:52:47] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:52:47] [server] This command gives you a list of your currently learned guild and
[2025-03-16 14:52:47] [server] skills related commands.  An example of such a command is judge.  The
[2025-03-16 14:52:47] [server] commands should also have help available on them.
[2025-03-16 14:52:47] [server] The default behaviour of the command is to print out the details in
[2025-03-16 14:52:47] [server] an area based output.  An area based output groups all the commands
[2025-03-16 14:52:47] [server] into various areas and then prints them out based on that area.  If
[2025-03-16 14:52:47] [server] you show the commands combined it shows them all in one group.
[2025-03-16 14:52:47] [server] Using the 'clear' syntax you can clear out a specific one of your
[2025-03-16 14:52:47] [server] commands if you do not want it any more for some reason.

[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] Description
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] The map command will show you what you can see of your surroundings
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] while you're travelling in a terrain or city environment.  Since
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] these maps are representations of what you can see, the map will only
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] show what is in your line of sight.  Hence large objects (mountains,
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] trees, city walls etc) block your view, and at night the distance you
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] can see shrinks substantially.
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] Terrains are areas where you can 'walk' or 'journey' in certain
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] directions.  These are all explained in 'help terrain room'.
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] Symbols are used to represent different types of terrain, such as
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] roads, forests and plains, which will correlate with what you see by
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] looking around you.  The map is centred on your location, marked with
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] a yellow @ symbol.
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] The maps use a minimal amount of colour to help differentiate types
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] of terrain.  This colouring can be disabled using 'options output map
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] plain = on'.
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] Lookmaps
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] If you would like to have a small map automatically displayed when
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] you enter a room, check out 'options output map' and set the glance,
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] glancecity, look and lookcity options appropriately.  For example, if
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] you have 'verbose look' turned on and you would like to see a map to
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] the left of your screen in cities but not in terrains, you want
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] 'options output map look = off' and 'options output map lookcity =
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] left'.  If you have 'brief look' turned on, then set 'options output
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] map glance' and 'options output map glancecity' instead.
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] Map Objects
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] In-game maps are available for parts of the Disc.  These can help you
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] determine where you are on the Disc and can be purchased from various
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] shops and NPCs.
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] Seeing things in your line-of-sight
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] The "map door text" syntax allows you to see all of the objects
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] (NPC's,  animals, other players, etc) that are on the paths around
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] you within your line of sight.  This is a limited number of rooms in
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] any direction, usually terminating at a junction.  The current
[2025-03-16 14:53:14] [server] weather may have an effect on the  distance you can see.

[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] A terrain room is part of a larger collection of rooms that connect
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] together and do wonderful things.  They are connected together via a
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] text map and allow larger areas to be mapped and navigated with
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] relative ease.
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] There are two methods of getting through a terrain, you can either
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] walk or journey.  If you walk then you move one step at a time, if
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] you use journey then you move multiple steps at a time.  The default
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] exit, as in the exit name without the 'walk' or 'journey' will pick
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] either one of these two methods to use.  The method chosen is set
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] using the 'options personal travel'.
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] While in a terrain it is possible to see the adjacent rooms around
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] you that are visible using the 'map' command.  The map will display a
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] small map on the screen allowing you to see the visible rooms around
[2025-03-16 14:53:26] [server] you.
