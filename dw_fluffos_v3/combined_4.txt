=== Content from Combat ===

==The Basics==
The first thing a new player should know about fighting is that you Pick On Things Your Own Size. A new character can find decent weapons and armour, but still has practically zero skills. He's not going to be able to fight even a child with a guarantee of success; larger things will likely squash him outright.

This is where the [[consider]] command comes in. It measures your strength-- based on your held weapons, worn armour, and [[hit points]]--and compares it to your target. A new player will find that he is roughly as strong as squirrels, rats and cockroaches.

Advancing your fighting skills will let you fight tougher foes successfully. For melee-friendly classes, like [[warriors]], [[assassins]], and, to a lesser extent, [[thieves]], can be done relatively easily; you simply find an NPC [[trainer]] and advance your combat-related skills, as explained in [[Introduction to Skills]]. It's important to advance the skills you actually ''use''; fighting.melee.dagger only helps when you're holding a dagger.

===Syntax===
To start fighting something, there are two syntaxes you can use:
&lt;pre>kill &lt;living>
attack &lt;living>&lt;/pre>

You can use either one with multiple targets; e.g., "kill bodyguards", "kill all" (not recommended), "kill all except pets", etc.

To stop fighting something, you can "stop fighting".  This has somewhat limited use, since it does not stop things from fighting ''you'' (they will still attack you if you go back into the room with them).

The command "[[score]] fighting" will tell you whether you are currently in combat with anything.

== More HP for Me==
You start off with 500 hp, or hit points.  That's '''dangerously''' low.  

You lose hp when successfully attacked and you will die when you lose all of your hp.  Attacks that do hundreds of hit points in one hit are '''VERY''' common.

Once you join a guild, you can advance adventuring.health to 25 in the guild. This will boost your maximum hp to roughly 1300.  You'll want more hp later but, for now, the extra 800 hit points will provide you a much needed safety buffer.

==Physical Weapons==
While some players opt to engage in physical combat with their hands and feet, the vast majority prefer the use of martial (or, occasionally, marital) weapons. 

Lighter weapons tend to be faster, but do less damage; the opposite is also true for their heavy counterparts. The real factor affecting a weapon's effectiveness, though, is the player holding it. A warrior with a 500 bonus in fighting.melee.dagger will be more effective with a dull butterknife than a brand-new player struggling to hold a Holy Blade of Soyin. Don't try to find the BESTEST WEAPON EVARR until you're more experienced; for now, choose a weapon you seem comfortable with.

==Armour== 
Armour, unlike weapons, does not rely on a player's skill to perform its function. A level 300 warrior wearing a steel breastplate is just as protected as a newbie wearing the same equipment. 

The most important things to remember about armour, as a newbie, are:
*'''Protect your vitals'''. On Discworld, this means primarily your neck, head, and chest (in that order).
*'''Watch your burden'''. Some armour is good; too much, however, can be disastrous. Acceptable burden for a dodge user is roughly 10-15 percent; a parry-based player can often get away with as much as 35% burden. In any case, don't let your burden climb past 50%; at that point, your abilities will start to be crippled by the weight.
*'''This isn't Dungeons and Dragons'''. All guilds are allowed to wear armour, so feel free to put on a breastplate, even if you're a wizard. 

==Magic and Faith==
The magic and faith-based classes may also advance their combat skills at their trainers, though to a much more limited extent. Their real strength lies, of course, in their own Guild's areas of expertise. For example:

Priests have, depending on their chosen god, access to a variety of helpful rituals. All Gods grant the [[Totem]] ritual, which summons a small supernatural being to the Priest's side. This being will throw itself in the way of most oncoming attacks, until it dies. While the Totem creature will attack foes, its offensive ability is severely limited. The totem's strength may be increased, however, by advancing the skill, faith.rituals.miscellaneous.target.

Rituals like these do not (usually) change a Priest's physical strength; nor will Spells normally alter the physical power of a Wizard or Witch. Nevertheless, these powers will greatly increase an arcane player's ability to defend him (or her) self and inflict mortal injury upon those foolish enough to harass them. 

Like more direct combat-based methods, spells and rituals may be strengthened by advancing the relevant skills.

==AP or R.I.P.==
Everyone in combat needs action points to make attacks or defend against attacks.  The MUD will never display the action points but you can see the results.

For a newbie, the most important parts are:

* Every time you do an action in combat: attack, dodge, parry, stand up after being tripped, etc., you spend Action Points. 
* If you are too busy defending, you will rarely, if ever attack.  When greatly outnumbered, you won't even be able to try to defend against all of the attacks. This can make fighting multiple opponents a fatal situation.
** Don't "kill all" as a newbie. You don't want to be outnumbered.
** Be careful when an NPC is in a room with potential allies.  One little old lady may seem killable.  She'll be a much tougher foe once her friends join the fight.
* Overwhelming a foe with attacks can work in your advantage.
** Group with friends and you can outnumber the NPCs.
** Some spells and rituals create NPCs that fight with you. A priest can outnumber foes using summoned allies.
** Picking a faster weapon, like daggers, can reduce the number of attacks a weak target makes--they'll be busy dodging your attacks.
* You can increase your speed in combat by advancing
** fighting.special.tactics
** the relevant fighting.defense.* skill(s)
** the relevant fighting.melee.* skill(s)

==Know when to run==
If you're in a fight and taking the worst of it, run.  The more hurt you are, the worse you are at combat--so get out of there before you die!

Many NPCs will try to follow you somewhat.  Moving two rooms has a decent chance of losing them. More distance is better, as NPCs may wander around.  If they wander into your room while they're still upset with you, they'll attack you on sight.

(Some NPCs are much more aggressive at chasing and can use [[pursue]]. These NPCs tend to be much too tough for newbies to fight.)

==Soul commands==
{{Main|Soul}}
&lt;div class="notice metadata" id="stub">
: ''See also: [https://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/playing/soul.c List of soul commands]''&lt;/div>
Some examples are: nod, smile, bing, dance, admire, fluff, zipzip, hug, slap, and timewarp. There are, however, hundreds more. You can see the list of souls in-game with &lt;code>look soul&lt;/code>, or &lt;code>look soul &lt;string>&lt;/code> to see the list of souls starting with a certain string.

There are some commands that share a name with a soul command. To make sure you're using the soul version of it, you can preface it with &lt;code>soul&lt;/code>. Alternatively, to make sure you're not using the soul, you can preface it with &lt;code>nosoul&lt;/code>. However, the MUD will generally pick the most appropriate version on its own. If you find yourself unexpectedly using the soul version, it may be because you can't use the other version&amp;mdash;for example, you may not have enough [[gp]], you may not be in combat with the target yet (as there is a slight delay between entering &lt;code>kill&lt;/code> and actually being in combat with them), you may be directing the command at an invalid target (such as trying to serenade yourself on an instrument), or you may be using the wrong [[syntax]].

==Other types of commands==
There are a great many commands that come from the rooms or objects. These will be hinted at in the description of the room or object in question.

While it may be difficult to document all of these, a few are more common.
*[[Journey]]
*[[Sew]]
*[[Write]]
*[[Map_(item)|Study]]

==Command Experience==
Any command that consumes more than five [[Guild Points]] will grant [[experience points]] when executed.

=== Content from Common_cold ===

==Catching the common cold==
You can catch the common cold by being very cold and wet, for an extended period.

Or by interacting with Pewsey at [[Granny's cottage]].

==Effects==
Effects include:
*Sniffling and sneezing, which (apart from being unsightly) will bring a player out of [[hide|hiding]].
*Cause the victim to lose 1 point of [[strength]] every 10 minutes, up to a maximum penalty of -6 str. This stat penalty is removed if you raise your body temperature to "very hot", but can return if you cool down again to "rather warm" or below {{research}}.

==Curing the common cold==
The common cold can be cured by drinking [[cold cure]] (this in turn will give you garlic breath, which wears off after a while but can be cured with [[breath freshener]], another [[Witch]] concoction).

The [[Soothing Rain]] ritual also cures colds.

The cold will also eventually wear off after approximately one hour (roundworld time).

==Preventing the common cold==
Players can avoid catching the common cold by any of the following:
*Not remaining cold and wet for extended periods.
*Having [[Granny Lipintense's Layer of Lard]] cast on them, or wearing a [[magick crystal]] imbued with that spell.
*Have a priest perform [[Warm]] on you.
*Wear an [[elegant ring]] from casting [[Gillimer's Ring of Temperate Weather]] to regulate your [[temperature]].
*Have a wizard cast [[Patient Taming of the Quantum Weather Butterfly]] to warm the room.

=== Content from Consecrate ===
 | gp = 50gp
 | learntat = guild level 50
 | skills = [[faith.rituals.special]]
 | items = item not consecrated to your deity
 | guild = [[Priests' Guild]]
}}

'''Consecrate''' is a priest command used to make an item holy to your specific [[:Category:Gods|deity]].  It can be learnt from your religious instructor at [[guild level]] 50.  It costs fifty guild points and uses the [[faith.rituals.special]] skill.

==Requirements==
First, you must be at a [[high altar]] of your deity.  Secondly, you must have [[pray]]ed enough recently&lt;ref>It's possible that [[burial commands]] would also count towards this (since they count as "actively worshipping"), but this has not been tested.{{Research}}&lt;/ref>, though the specific amount of praying necessary is unknown.  This may be what is meant by "in good standing" in the help file for the command.  Finally, you must be in [[alignment]].

A failure due to a simple lack of skill looks like this:
&lt;pre>You begin to perform the ceremony of consecration.
You clear your mind and focus on the glory of Gapp.
You attempt to consecrate the powder blue hoop skirt but Gapp seems to be far away.&lt;/pre>
(A bonus of around 150-200 is necessary to begin to succeed at consecration.)

A failure due to not having prayed enough recently, on the other hand, looks like this:
&lt;pre>You begin to perform the ceremony of consecration.
You attempt to contact Gapp but His attention seems to be elsewhere. &lt;/pre>

==Uses==
A [[faith rod]] must be consecrated to the deity you worship before you can use it.  So must [[holy symbol]]s, [[holy relic]]s (though they can't actually be reconsecrated), [[prayer beads]], [[holy amulet]]s, and [[prayer book]]s.  Uniquely, [[Hat]]tites can use these items as ritual components even if they're consecrated to other deities.  Additionally, you can only hold prayer beads--and therefore charge them and potentially get the bonus to wisdom--if they are consecrated to your deity, a restriction that does apply to Hattites.

You can verify if an item is consecrated and to which deity by the [[Description_line_(item)#Holyness|holyness line]] seen when looking at the item.

Also, there are a few rituals performed on items that require that item to be consecrated first:
*[[Divine Guard]]
*[[Divine Sentinel]]
*[[Remember Place]]
*[[Weft Warping]]

==Reconsecrating==
Most items can be reconsecrated; you just consecrate them as normal.  You can therefore get holy amulets, prayer beads, regular holy symbols, and prayer books dedicated to deities you don't worship, consecrate them, and use them thereafter.

Prayer books, when reconsecrated, will retain the name of the deity they were originally dedicated to, but crossed out or scribbled out.  They will keep any prayers they contained before.  In fact, this is how you get prayers from other deities (for rituals in faith rods)--you give the prayer book to a priest of that diety to reconsecrate and give to their religious instructor, and then consecrate it back.

Holy relics and ''wearable'' holy symbols may not be reconsecrated, although you can attempt to do so, spending gp in the process.

Reconsecrating a [[faith rod]] either removes the ritual from the rod entirely (if the ritual is not at the highest level, imprinted), or removes ''almost'' all the charge from the rod (if the rod is imprinted).

Reconsecrating prayer beads removes all charge from them.

[[Ward]]ed items stay warded when reconsecrated, so you can combine rituals from different deities as wards if you like.

Reconsecrating also leaves [[Remember Place|remembered places]] intact; to get rid of a remembered place you need to [[scour]] it out.

==Achievements==
There is one achievement in the Priests category related to this command:
*{{Achievement|Consecrator}} (Small)

=== Content from Consider ===

The consider command attempts to measure your combat ability against that of a potential foe. As players get stronger, the command becomes less accurate, having to take into consideration many different factors.

People and NPCs being considered will be notified of the attempt and may react. A common NPC reaction is drawing weapons, which also serves to make the command more accurate. A player may attempt to consider covertly, which can be used to consider without notifying the target.

== Notes ==


*A dog considered a lot weaker, but was able to shred me. (This may have been because I didn't have the skills to keep parrying an unarmed opponent.)
*Switching from a twenty pound mail hauberk to a thirty pound jazerant didn't seem to make a difference in considers.
*Unholding/holding weapons varies consider depending on a persons skills. For example, Imperial Guards will typically judge one or two notches lower until they draw their weapons. The same applies for the Hashishim in Djelibeybi.
*There's plenty of room - tens of bonus - in which a meleeist will be quagmired in ambiguous 'about equal' territory.
*Once upon a time, you could give items to NPCs. Once you gave enough stuff to them, they would consider easier. This likely coincides with the dex loss from burden or due combat penalties from burden. However, you can no longer do this but you may be able to plant heavy items on them as well such as hundreds of AM pence. This may have been fixed.
*Another interesting oddity is that NPCs will sometimes consider differently Very briefly when they first appear, regardless of equipment. It may be that the stats/skills for the NPC have not been set yet.

Don't forget &lt;tt>consider covert&lt;/tt> for a way of [[TM]]'ing [[co.po]] and [[co.ca.pe]] as this has no skill prerequisites!

=== Content from Constitution ===

==Direct effects==
*Higher levels of constitution reduce the [[poison|poisoning]] time from various sources.

==Skill relationships==

*Constitution features prominently in the [[Skills - Adventuring|adventuring]] skill tree.  Crucially, it affects [[adventuring.health]], and by extension, a player's [[hit points|hit point]] total.
*It has a moderate influence in the [[Skills - Fighting|fighting]] skill tree.
*It features little if at all in all the other skill trees.

==Guild reliance==

*[[Warriors]] often have reasonable levels of constitution due to their reliance on physical combat without [[:Category:Arcane shielding|arcane shielding]]; their [[hit points|hit point]] totals make up for this.
*[[Thieves]], while often combat-oriented, tend not to go for much constitution, instead putting the points into [[Dexterity|dexterity]]. Non-combat oriented thieves have even less use for constitution.
*[[Assassins]], while combat-oriented, tend not to go for much constitution, instead putting the points into [[Dexterity|dexterity]].
*[[Priests]] may utilize constitution to augment their healing skills.
*[[Wizards]] require constitution for the [[magic.methods.elemental|elemental]] skill subtree and [[magic.spells.defensive|defensive]] skill.
*[[Witches]] do not use [[magic.methods.elemental|elemental]] skills much, so only require constitution for the [[magic.spells.defensive|defensive]] skill.

=== Content from Container ===

==Specific containers==
Some containers only accept a specific type of item. The advantage of using those containers is that they only count as one item against the item limit of the container, thus you can keep a lot more of the specific items that you could otherwise.
*[[First aid kits]] : [[bandage]]s
*[[Charm bracelet]]s : [[charms]]
*[[Ink rack]]s : [[ink]]s
*[[Spell case]]s : [[magic scroll]]s

==Custom containers==
You can order a variety of sacks, bags and packs at [[Baguette's custom bags]] shop.

[[Mrs._Cosmopilite|Mrs. Cosmopilite]] can make custom backpacks, satchels (small/medium/large), shoulder pouches, belts, garters and suspenders in addition to other clothing on which you can add [[Clothing_with_pockets|pockets]].

==Dry containers==
These containers can only hold dry things, not liquids.  Some of them can be worn.

Precise weights (as measured on the post office balance) and capacities (figured out by actually putting things into the container) should be bolded.  Weights gotten by hand-weighing the container, and capacities gotten from appraise, shouldn't be.

This table uses a special template, {{tl|Con}}, to calculate useful ratios from the weight and capacities.  See that template's page for details on using it.

[[Back containers]], [[Clothing with pockets]], items from [[Baguette]]'s shop and [[writing boxes]] are included from their respective pages. This helps to prevent this page becoming too big to save edits.

=== Content from Corpse_parts ===

If you are holding a [[knife]] or [[dagger]], you can cut pieces from corpses with "get &lt;bit> from corpse".  Body parts thus gotten can be referred to collectively as "bits".

Soft corpse bits can be eaten, [[pickler|pickled]], used for [[Food of Life]], used as the focus for the [[Sek]] [[totem]], or burned in the [[Sek]] fire pit in [[Djelibeybi]] for a slight evil [[alignment]] shift.  Some soft bits however contain bony bits, which must be removed before the soft bits can be eaten.

Some specific corpse bits are components in [[spells]], [[rituals]], or [[poisons]], while a few have other uses.

Some bits contain other bits--for example, a head contains a skull.  You can either get the skull directly from the corpse, or get the head from the corpse and then get the skull from the head.

Cutting heavy bits off of a corpse can make it marginally lighter, and therefore easier to drag.  If the bit is too heavy for you to pick up, it will be left on the corpse (but carried instead of attached).

===Available corpse bits===
Different corpses are composed of different parts.  The short description of the bit will indicate the type of corpse it was gotten from, like "a human skin".

There is a [[:Category:Corpse parts|category for specific corpse parts]].

=== Content from Corpse ===

==Player corpses==
When you [[death|die]], you will naturally leave behind a corpse with all your stuff on it.  If you are not a [[playerkiller]], nobody except you will be able to get things from it unless you "permit" them.  If you ''are'' a playerkiller, other playerkillers will be able to get things from your corpse without permission (although this will set off any wards on those items), but npks will still need to be permitted--and npks will need to be permitted before they can use [[Find Corpse]] on you.

Nobody except you will be able to drag your corpse unless you permit them, and corpses cannot be dragged in [[water room]]s.

Unlike npc corpses, player corpses are saved over [[reboot]]s.

==Wards==
Getting items from a corpse will set off any [[ward]]s on those items, unless it's your own corpse or one the owner has permitted you to take things from it.

==Decaying==
Any corpse will decay after a while, leaving behind all the stuff it had on it.  At this point anyone can pick up the stuff and it will be lost if the room reloads or the MUD [[reboot]]s or crashes.

Corpses go through several stages of decay, visible in the short description:
*"the corpse of &lt;dead thing>"
*"the somewhat decayed remains of a corpse"
*"the decayed remains of &lt;dead thing>"

It takes an npc corpse between nineteen and twenty real minutes to decay fully.  

A player corpse, however, lasts for nearly a real-life hour.  A player corpse will turn into "the somewhat decayed remains of a corpse" after approximately fifty minutes, and "the decayed remains of a human" after approximately fifty-five minutes.  Up until the fifty-five minute mark, looking at the corpse will show the line, "This is the dead body of &lt;player name>."  After that, it will only say, "This is the dead body of a human" and won't be identifiable just by looking.

Corpse bits do not always go through stages of decay on their own (although they will decay into dust abruptly), but have different descriptions based on the state of the corpse you cut them from.
*"This is a fresh &lt;body part> severed from the corpse of a &lt;type>."
*"This is a &lt;body part> severed from the corpse of a &lt;type>."
*"This is the partially decayed remains of &lt;body part> severed from the corpse of a &lt;type>.

If a bit is taken from an npc corpse immediately after death, it will take slightly over thirteen minutes to decay.  If there is time between the death and taking the bit from the corpse, then the time between taking the bit and the bit decaying fully will be shorter, ''but'' the time between death and the bit decaying will be longer.

The temperature of a room has no effect on how quickly corpses and bits decay.

==Burial==
Npc corpses can be [[bury|buried]] and recovered; if you kill something then a large chunk of [[xp]] is received when the corpse is first buried.

[[Burial commands|Ritual burial]] is also an option for priests--this takes 50 gp per corpse, and gives command xp and an [[alignment]] shift as well as burial xp.  Although the descriptions for the commands tend to indicate that the corpse is destroyed or taken elsewhere, it can still be recovered.

In some places, trying to bury a corpse will result in it falling into a different room; this is true on bridges (the corpse falls to the room underneath) and the wall around [[Djelibeybi]].  In this case they can't be recovered; you have to go to the room they're in to get to them.

&lt;!--Can pk corpses be buried? --~~~~ -->

{{Include|Corpse parts}}

==Scavengers==
Certain animals will tear off and eat bits of corpses that are in the room with them.  These include:
*crabs on the [[Ankh-Morpork|Ankh river]]
*rats in [[Ankh-Morpork]] and [[Bes Pelargic]]
*crows in the [[Sto Plains]] (they will sometimes fly into the room to eat parts of corpses when you kill something)
*vultures
*small birds (woodpeckers, sparrows, etc) at the Chronides Farm

==Vampirism==
When an npc or player is killed by a [[vampire]], their corpse may rise as a vampire.  You can tell whether this will happen or not by looking at the corpse--if it will rise again, it will have a line after the description saying that it's twitching and you shouldn't get too close.

Corpses thus afflicted cannot be buried, but you ''can'' get items from them as normal.  They seem to rise as vampires ''either'' at the same time they would normally decay, or shortly after everything has been looted from the corpse.

When the vampire rises, it will drop everything that was on the corpse (and acquire some more suitable clothing at the same time), then attack any players in the room.

==Embalming==
You can get corpses embalmed at the [[Guild of Embalmers and Allied Trades]] in [[Djelibeybi]], on Market Street.  You must first "buy a chit for &lt;corpse>" in the reception foyer (you'll be told how much the chit will cost before you have to pay for it), after which you can go downstairs and get the corpse mummified in Gern and Dil's room.  This turns it into a mummy--it can still be referred to as a "corpse", but it can't be [[burial commands|ritually buried]] anymore.

{{Prebox|Bandages have been tightly wrapped around the body.  Here and there pieces have come loose and hang off.  The fact that even the face and eyes have been tightly wrapped could explain why most mummies walk around with their arms spread forward.  A strange smell lingers in the air around it.}}

Summons a swarm of insects to fight alongside you.  They are a type of [[:Category:Minions|minion]].

__TOC__

==Description==
Summons a swarm of insects which will assist you in combat, a more powerful version of dust devil. Also the victim of people screaming ‘Downgrade’, they no longer protect the priest in combat. The insects can cause temporary stat and skill losses with poison attacks.

What part of.ar plays is not known, it might make the creeping doom better at combat.  Some of this skill is certainly needed to be able to summon the cloud. It also seems to determine how large a newly summoned doom is.

They can be referred to as cloud, doom, minion, summon, or creature.

Dooms can be treacherous: there are several circumstances which can cause them to "[https://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/blog/blog.c?action=filter&amp;blog=recent%20developments&amp;id=279 take advantage of your lapse in attention]" to turn on you and/or your pets. [[Talk:Creeping_Doom#Log_of_doom_attacking_me.2C_pet | Log showing this]].  These circumstances include:
*If you try and fail to summon another minion
*If they get too strong for you to control from devouring corpses
*If you try and fail to feed them gp

If a cloud turns on you, you can "lose doom" to get away from it.

Clouds can be ordered to devour corpses.  This makes them bigger and stronger, but it may also cause them to turn on you (depending on your own skills).  Both the effect on the cloud and the odds of it attacking you go up with the size of the corpse, so feeding them very large corpses (such as those from elephants) is not advised.  They won't devour a corpse that's been buried and recovered, and you don't get burial xp from corpses they devour.

This summons a swarm of flesh-eating insects to assist you in harming others.  It will not protect you, but will attack your enemies for you.  To perform this ritual, you need a holy symbol, a prayer book, and a relic consecrated to your deity.  A priest can only control one swarm at a time.

= Example =
 > perform creeping doom
 You raise your hands, and swirl them about.
 You speak the holy word of Sek.
 You summon a cloud of insects.
 Thousands of insects gather to form an unbelievably large black cloud.

}}
'''Crush''' is a [[:Category:Warrior commands|warrior-only command]] that is used mid combat. Whether a weapon is capable of crushing can be found through use of the [[judge]] command. 

[[Special:WhatLinksHere/Crush| Pages that link to this page]]: mostly weapons that this command can be used with.

__TOC__
{{-}}
==Acquisition==
Crush can be learned at 150 levels of [[fighting.special.weapon]] from a guild instructor or from another player who has the command.

== Syntax ==
 crush &lt;target> with &lt;weapon>
 crush &lt;target> &lt;random|hands|feet|legs|arms|neck|back|ribs|kneecaps|skull> with &lt;weapon>
 crush compare &lt;zone 1> with &lt;zone 2>

== Target zones ==
Damage, preparation difficulty, launch difficulty and guild point cost will depend on the zone targeted. From weakest to most damaging the target zones and associated guild point cost are:
 35gp hands|feet
 35gp legs
 35gp arms
 35gp neck
 40gp back
 45gp ribs|kneecaps
 45gp skull
Generally the launch difficulty is constant and the preparation difficulty scales with damage but there are exceptions where:
*a crush targeting the ribs (45gp) is just as difficult to prepare as one targeting the neck (35gp) and easier than one targeting the back (40gp), though it inflicts more damage than both,
*a crush targeting the kneecaps is hardest to prepare of all but is easier to launch.

== Crush Messages ==
If a successful crush kills the target, a special message may be displayed. 
* As the &lt;victim> absorbs a blow from your &lt;weapon>, &lt;his/her/its> body gives way and folds like an accordion.  Perhaps a skilled musician could play a triumphant jig on it.
*The &lt;victim> suffers the full brunt of a blow from your &lt;weapon>, reducing &lt;his/her/its> resulting cadaver to something more resembling a drawing by an angry child than anything once alive.
*Chunks of flesh are hurled into the air by the force of your final swing of your &lt;weapon>, leaving the &lt;victim> in several bloody pieces on the ground.  The gravedigger isn't going to be best pleased.
*You launch a powerful attack with your &lt;weapon>. Something between a squelch and a crunch emanates from the &lt;victim> as &lt;his/her/its> corpse collapses in a graceless heap.
*You turn the &lt;victim>'s &lt;body part> into a pulpy mess of flesh and bone with a powerful swing of your &lt;weapon>, killing &lt;his/her/it> outright.
*Your final blow with your &lt;weapon> hits the &lt;victim> with a sickening crunch as bones shatter, sending &lt;his/her/it> sprawling lifelessly.
*You launch a powerful attack with your &lt;weapon>. The &lt;victim> succumbs to your battery and dies, concave in all the wrong places.
*Your &lt;weapon> collides with the &lt;victim>'s body at such a speed that it reduces &lt;his/her/its> carcass to a pulp of tissue, limbs and indeterminate organs.  All that remain are... remains.
*You slam your &lt;weapon> into the &lt;victim> with enough force to lift &lt;his/her/it> a foot off the ground, spinning in a slow circle before &lt;his/her/it> lands in a messy, bloodied heap.
*A series of sharp but muffled cracks can be heard as the &lt;victim>'s ribcage is pulverised by a crushing blow from your &lt;weapon>.
*The top of the &lt;victim>'s skull collapses in on &lt;his/her/it>self as you crush it with your sledgehammer, sending chunks of brain and bone splattering about.
*As your &lt;weapon>  connects, the &lt;victim> watches &lt;his/her/its> ribs splinter and cave in, puncturing &lt;his/her/its> lungs and other organs before &lt;his/her/it> collapses with a gurgle, flecks of bloody foam on &lt;his/her/its> lips.
*As your &lt;weapon> smashes into the &lt;victim>'s stomach, &lt;his/her/it> doubles over.  The one thing learned from &lt;his/her/its> death is that &lt;his/her/it> had a kebab for supper.
*&lt;victim> suddenly finds &lt;him/her/itself> much shorter (and significantly more dead) as you slam your &lt;weapon> down on &lt;his/her/its> head.
*&lt;victim>'s skull explodes beneath a powerful blow from your &lt;weapon>, flinging blood, bone and brain several feet through the air, coating the area in gore and leaving a convulsing corpse on the ground.  This is why you never get hired as an interior decorator.
* A final blow from your &lt;weapon> tears the &lt;victim>'s jaw from his skull.  Perhaps a closed casket would be best.
* With a brutal swipe of your &lt;weapon>, the &lt;victim> is mashed to the ground.  &lt;His/Her/Its> death throes are, unsurprisingly, short-lived.
* Your &lt;weapon> connects with enough force to take the wind, and life, out of the &lt;victim>. &lt;His/Her/It> flies several feet through the air before the &lt;victim>'s corpse finally lands.
* Your &lt;weapon> smashes into the &lt;victim>'s stomach, and &lt;he/she/it> doubles over.  The one thing learned from &lt;he/she/it> death is that &lt;he/she/it> had &lt;food> for &lt;meal>.
=== Troll-specific Messages ===
*The &lt;troll> stumbles as a colossal lump of stone is torn loose from &lt;his/her> frame by your &lt;weapon>.  There is a long moment where nothing happens before &lt;his/her> collapses into a mound of rubble.
*You launch a powerful attack with your &lt;weapon>, connecting directly with the &lt;troll>'s head.  The &lt;troll> is smote to the ground with such force and ferocity that there'll be no need for a chalk outline.
