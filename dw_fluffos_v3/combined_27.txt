As you enter into Sekiri's study to find out a little more about some of the spells you have now found out about, you see the old man sitting by the fireplace deeply engrossed in a hefty book, which you notice has the title <a href= "http://spc.darkmud.co.uk/index.php" target="new">The Spellcheck Project</a> embossed in the leather binding.<br><br>

After grabbing Sekiri's attention by merely saying "Excuse me" in what nearly amounts to a yell, Sekiri finally looks up. "Ah yes, what can I do for you today, youngster?" After mentioning your need, Sekiri continues "I was actually just reading some recently published material about that myself. Amazing what some of these youngsters can do with Hex these days, so many different numbers they come up with." As he speaks, Sekiri grabs a couple of books from the shelf and hands them to you. Peering at them quickly you see that they are Spells of Wizardry Volume I, and Spells of Wizardry Volume II, both written by Sekiri Thanatos.<br><br>

As you thank Sekiri, he adds "A while after I published those, a few people started asking me exactly what those ratings I added to each spell mean. Eventually, I ended up writing an explanation down. I think I have them on a piece of paper somewhere around here." Sekiri searches his desk for a few long minutes. "Ah, here we are." He hands it to you and you quickly <a href="spellskey.html" target="right"><b>scan the piece of paper for the explanation</b></a>, particularly interested in the mortality information.<br><br>

You sit down and open the books and start to read.<br><br>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS SPELLS</h2>


<h3><a name="acts">A Cup of Tea and Sake</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 15<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 25<br>
<i>Components</i>: A paper (consumed).<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Divinational Arts<br>
<i>Methods</i>: channeling, divining, scrying.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 70, 120, 170.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This spell acts as a reverse scry and enables the caster to show a friend just where on the Disc the caster is.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Toy Spell<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Nothing more to it really, might be fun once or twice, but no real use.<br><br>



<h3><a name="al">Al'Hrahaz's Scintillating Blorpler</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 25<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 90<br>
<i>Components</i>: Requires the focus of an octogram.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: First<br>
<i>Location</i>: Spelles of thee Oryent<br>
<i>Methods</i>: evoking, channeling, evoking, chanting, chanting.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 230 evoking, 260 channeling, 270 chanting for the second check.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This spell records a location in a piece of target jewellery to be used in <a href="#port">Jogloran's Portal of Cheaper Travel</a>. The advantage of this spell is that jewellery does not (generally) disappear, but rather (may) lose condition when it is used as the target of a portal. This means that if jewellery is kept in excellent condition, it should virtually never have to be replaced.<br><br>

The does however depend on the type of jewellery which you use. The more expensive the jewellery is, the more damage or casts it can take before losing condition or disappearing entirely. This can make it a good idea to use fairly expensive jewellery for commonly used portal locations. Jewellery should be checked every so often for normal wear and tear.<br><br>

If the caster has insufficient skill to blorple an item, the item in question will explode into millions of tiny pieces, and will hurt, or even kill the caster. A magical impact shield can reduce or absorb part of this damage, so any caster should ensure that they have one active. It is possible that a buffer spell may reduce the fire component of the damage, but this has not been verified.<br><br> 

It is recommended that precious or expensive pieces of jewellery are not used until the caster has significantly more than the minimum skills required to cast the spell. You may not only have to replace the piece of jewellery, but also the caster's own hide.<br><br>

There are dozens of stores and places that one can buy all sorts of jewellery on the Disc, from cheap brass rings to beautiful custom pieces that cost hundreds of dollars. The most commonly used piece is a simple gold ring, offering a balance between durability and cost, with a popular slightly more upmarket ring being the rose rhodonite ring from a jewellers on Butterfly Boulevard, Bes Pelargic.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Moderate<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Thyngs Can Go Wrong<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Useful to Must Have<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Every wizard should, at least eventually, be making all of their own blorps. If you don't think this spell is must have, you should have tried the days before this spell!<br><br>



<h3><a name="sil">Amazing Silicate Blorpler</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 5<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 10<br>
<i>Components</i>: None.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: First<br>
<i>Location</i>: Begynners' Magick<br>
<i>Methods</i>: evoking, channeling, evoking, chanting, chanting.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 80 evoking, 60 channeling, 70 chanting.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Amazing Silicate Blorpler codes the casters current location in the target for use in <a href="#port">Jogloran's Portal of Cheaper Travel</a>. Its use, along with Jogloran's will allow the caster to travel back to the location that it was 'blorped' at.<br><br>

A rock (around 10 pounds), a stone (2-3 pounds), a cobble (1 3/9th pounds) or a pebble can be used as the target. The smaller the target used, the higher the caster's ma.sp.misc bonus will need to be. A bonus of around 200 should allow a successful cast on pebbles. A failure will cause an explosion similar to the jewellery version, though much less powerful.<br><br>

When a silicate blorp is used to cast Jogloran's, then it will usually disappear. Multiple uses of the same blorp only occur around ten percent of the time for low skills, though this may be improved with further training. This then makes this a spell to be used only until a wizard can make or obtain jewellery with encoded locations. If you have forgotten the location that a blorped silicate is remembering, you can cast <a href="#glance">Worstler's Elementary Mineralogical Glance</a> to scry the location. In fact, some wizards use these two spells in conjunction for precisely that purpose.<br><br>

Rocks and stones can be purchased from the rock shop on Quarry lane, and pebbles from the nearby troll street vendor. Cobbles can be gotten from the pile directly outside the entrance to the Magical Supplies Emporium. You can also obtain free rocks at several places, such as on Sion Street, Bes Pelargic.<br><br>

In addition, it is also possible to blorp a rock or stone, and then chip pebbles from of them. In fact, if you chip pebbles from an already blorped rock, those pebbles will have that location already encoded.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Student<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Minimal<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Reasonable Option<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: A spell for students, both to practice their skills, and even perhaps to use before they obtain jewellery blorps, though the rising difficulty of Jogloran's has made that problematical. Some may still use it to encode locations to scry.<br><br>



<h3><a name="wonder">Atmospheric Inscription Wonder</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 25<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 80<br>
<i>Components</i>: A quill, and a torch (both consumed).<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Spelles of thee Arte of Fyre<br>
<i>Methods</i>: animating, fire, binding, channeling.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 120.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This spell allows a wizard to write a message of their choice in the sky by pyrotechnics using 'firewrite'. The message will be visible to all outdoors and roughly within shouting distance.<br><br>

The length of the message will be limited, but coloured fireworks can be used. You can buy quills at many different legibles stores Disc wide for around $2.50, including the shop in the Magical Supplies Emporium just across from the UU. Torches can likewise be bought Disc-wide.<br><br>

Beginning wizards might try to make a little cash by offering to advertise others.<br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy <br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Toy Spell<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Guaranteed to amaze and amuse, for a short while.<br><br>



<h3><a name="fireworks">Bifram's Amazing Fireworks</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 15<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 50<br>
<i>Components</i>: A torch (consumed).<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Spelles of thee Arte of Fyre<br>
<i>Methods</i>: animating, fire, binding, channeling.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 130, 120, 140, 140.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This spell is similar to the <a href="#wonder">Atmospheric Inscription Wonder</a> except the fireworks will only display the name of the caster, you cannot change the message. Advantage is that it does not require or consume a quill to cast.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Pointless<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Unlike AIW, you can't even change the message, so rather pointless.<br><br>



<h3><a name="booch">Booch's Extremal Polymorphism</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 45<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 70<br>
<i>Components</i>: A dwarf, human and troll arm (all consumed). Requires an octogram.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Ye Booke of Polymorphe<br>
<i>Methods</i>: channeling, convoking, evoking, binding, animating.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 215.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Booch's, if successful, gives the caster one additional arm per cast. Where the arm appears seems to be completely random, and locations include armpit, neck and forehead. A wizard could try to cast the spell a second time for a total of four arms, but to do so would require extremely high level skills. The spell is permanent.<br><br>

Why extra arms, you ask? The advantage is that it allows you to hold extra weapons in combat. It does not allow you to wear more rings or bracelets, nor can you wear two sets of iron gauntlets even with four arms. However, a neck arm may prevent you from wearing necklaces, and a head arm your hat or bronze helm.<br><br>

Booch's does have a number of disadvantages. In addition to possibly preventing the caster from wearing some items, if the arms which the caster has are unbalanced, i.e. unequal number on the right and left hand sides of the body, they will receive a penalty to their dexterity, which may be one or two points depending on the location.<br><br>

The other key limitation of this spell is that for whatever reason, not only is your new arm susceptible to damage in combat, but so to are the caster's original pair. It is quite possible for the caster to lose not only their new but also original arms in combat, and is thought to be more likely when parrying. Hence a user of this spell can end up with only one, or even no arms. This can only be remedied by re-casting the spell and hoping for the best, or, by obtaining an entirely new body.<br><br>

Finally, miscasting the spell can cost the wizard one of their original arms immediately, though it is more likely to simply consume the components for no result. It's worth noting for those who are somewhat frail that troll children's arms weigh much less than those of their parents!<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: <br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: <br>
<i>Overall</i>: Quite Fun<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Some wizards may get some fun out of this spell, despite its drawbacks.<br><br>



<h3><a name="bool">Boolywog's Forbidden Pleasures</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 10<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 25<br>
<i>Components</i>: A potato (consumed). Requires an octogram.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Begynners' Magick<br>
<i>Methods</i>: chanting, charming, summoning.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 50, 60, 110.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This spell summons a succubus (or incubus) to give you "unimaginable delights". This is naturally, having your choice of mashed, fried, or baked potato.<br><br>

The succubus cannot be killed, and, should you try you will become possessed and be hurt or even killed. The succubus (or incubus) disappears once you make your choice.<br><br>

The potato can be bought from various vegetable shops around the Disc.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Student<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Minimal<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Toy Spell<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Wink wink, need I say more?<br><br>



<h3><a name="cab">Brassica Oleracea Ambulata</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 10<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 25<br>
<i>Components</i>: None.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Cunjuryng for Begynners<br>
<i>Methods</i>: evoking, channeling, animating.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: Around 100.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Brassica Oleracea Ambulata creates an animated cabbage to follow (and adore) the target. This target does not necessarily have to be the caster, and it can be cast on anyone.<br><br>

No more than three cabbages can be created to love a single target. Some wizards wandering around AM will often have a little bit of fun and cast one on you as well. If a wizard gets tired of having a cabbage follow them, they can always eat it, pickle it, or take care of it with its natural enemy, the caterpillar.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Student<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Toy Spell<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Toy spell, of no real practical use, though it often annoys others.<br><br>



<h3><a name="enchant">Brother Happalon's Elementary Enchanting</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 5<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 35<br>
<i>Components</i>: A funnel.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: First<br>
<i>Location</i>: Introeductyon too thee Strukture of thee Multyverss<br>
<i>Methods</i>: evoking, enchanting, chanting, enchanting.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 70, 90, 80, 105.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Brother Happalon's enchants a target item to a certain level depending on a number of factors. It can continue to be cast on a particular item until a backwash of thaumic energy is seen. At this point, that item cannot be enchanted further.<br><br>

Various items will have differing points at which the backwash will occur, even aside from the influence of the caster's skill. Clothing and jewellery for instance, will almost never go beyond slightly enchanted, and you will not be able to enchant the vast majority of items past softly pulses in dull octarine shades with this spell, regardless of skill.<br><br>

The spell requires a thaumic funnel as a component, which can be made by casting <a href="#funnel">Objandeller's Thaumic Funnel</a>. Once you reach the backwash (and if you continue to enchant afterwards), or even often before, the funnel will either disappear with a pop!, fall to the ground, turn into a caterpillar or do nothing.<br><br> 

A full discussion of enchanting and how it effects the target items will be available in your  <a href="enchant.html" target="right">post-graduate studies on enchanting</a>.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Student<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Useful<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Not only useful for enchanting some items to at least a low level, it is also required before you can enchant things with <a href="#glim">Master Glimer's Amazing Glowing Thing</a>.<br><br>


 
<h3><a name="cbib">Cherry Blossoms in Bloom</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 10<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 25<br>
<i>Components</i>: Requires an octogram.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Illusionary Arts<br>
<i>Methods</i>: air, channeling, convoking.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 140, 160, 140.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This is an aura spell which causes sortilege. Cherry Blossoms in Bloom will cause the target of the spell, caster or otherwise, to bloom in flaming colour.  The colour completely depends on who the caster is, i.e. their order. The effects may last up to an hour.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Toy Spell<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Simply adds an additional line in the target's description, with an occasional more obvious display.<br><br>



<h3><a name="pickle">Collatrap's Instant Pickling Stick</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 10<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 20<br>
<i>Components</i>: None.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Begynners' Magick<br>
<i>Methods</i>: conjuring, evoking, wand, dancing.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 100, 120, 160, 100.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Collatrap's conjures into the caster's inventory a wand of pickling or 'small stick'. It can be used to pickle body parts and other perishables such as carrots from decaying. Unfortunately it does not work on whole corpses, no matter how many times you use it.<br><br>

To use the pickling stick, a wizard must hold the stick and simply zap their desired target with the stick to pickle it.<br><br>

Depending on the spells of the caster, the stick will appear with a varying number of charges. A skilled wizard may be able to get up to 15 charges from a single cast, though less than that is obviously normal for most.<br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Useful<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Any wizard who uses a spell that requires body parts will know exactly how useful this spell can be.<br><br>



<h3><a name="detect">Crondor's Fabulous Detection</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 10<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 15<br>
<i>Components</i>: A gold ring, and a staff.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: First<br>
<i>Location</i>: Intermediate Artifact Magic, fourth ed.<br>
<i>Methods</i>: staff, gold, turning.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 130.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Fabulous Detection attempts to probe a magical artifact to discover whether it can stand up to recharging. Note that it only tests whether the artifact itself can handle a recharge, it does not indicate whether the particular wizard casting the spell can safely recharge that item.<br><br>

This spell was developed by Crondor in an attempt to lower the mortality rate amongst rechargers. As an item is recharged, it gradually loses the ability to handle any more charges. Once an item reaches the point at which it cannot, it often takes a recharging wizard with it.<br><br>

When the spell is cast successfully on an item, it will briefly glow a particular colour. That colour tells you how likely it is that the artifact can safely handle another charge. Those colours, in order of safest to most likely to blow up are purple, green, red, blue, orange, pink, yellow, cyan, indigo and vermilion. The spell does return variable results, presumably based on the skill of the caster, and if the artifact is at a borderline stage, a wise caster may wish to use several casts to take an average. It would be foolhardy to ignore the warning that any of the colours below orange serve to give in most cases. For an artifact that is likely to be fatal, anything less than purple or perhaps green is living dangerously.<br><br>

Note that it is still perfectly possible for a recharger to blow up an artifact reporting only purple, from failing the later, different check, of whether the recharge was successful.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Useful<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Absolutely vital in the repeated recharging of dangerous artifacts.<br><br>



<h3><a name="cms2">Crondor's Marvellous Sequestration</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 60<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 350<br>
<i>Components</i>: A sapphire ring and a handful of purple mineral powder (both consumed).<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Zeroth<br>
<i>Location</i>: Thee Secrets of Artifyce and Crafte<br>
<i>Methods</i>: staff, ring, convoking, enchanting, binding<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 220, 280, est. 250 remainder.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Crondor's Marvellous Sequestration is a spell that enables a wizard to place his staff between here and there. It does so by turning the sapphire ring into a mystical star sapphire ring with an arcane connection to the staff, allowing the caster to slip it into a pocket of some other reality for awhile and retrieve it later.<br><br>

The spell must be cast on the staff to which the connection is to be made, and said staff must be held by the caster. Once the spell is cast, the wizard must then wear the star sapphire ring to take any further actions with it. The wizard can then store their staff between here and there, and then at a later time, retrieve the staff from elsewhere.<br><br> 

A certain amount of skill will be required both to slip the staff between the folds of reality, and to summon the staff, and it may take a number of attempts. It costs no energy to store the staff, but takes approximately 50 guild points to make an attempt to retrieve it. On retrieving the staff, the wizard may also mistime their grab and be hit in the head by it. An impact shield will protect against this damage.<br><br> 

The star sapphire ring can store only the staff on which the spell is first cast, and it cannot be used by anyone other than the caster.<br><br>

Purple mineral powder can be gained by pulverising purple mineral nuggets with a hammer. You can purchase the nuggets from the Guild of Alchemists in Ankh-Morpork, or the House of Magic in Creel Springs. Alternatively, purple mineral powder can sometimes be found flowing through the streams of Blue Moon Park in Bes Pelargic. Sapphire rings can be purchased from a shop on Grunefair street, Ankh-Morpork, or a fancy jewellery in the Djelibeybi bazaar for around $75, making this a very expensive spell to cast.<br><br>

You should also be careful of any other sapphire rings you may have on your person, as they may interfere with the spell.<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Most useful for those wizards who only occasionally use their staff, for example to be used in spells or octograving, where it can be a very efficient way to carry it around. Could also be used to carry around a spare staff, or just delight onlookers when you summon your staff from afar!<br><br>

Crondor's Mysterious Sparkling makes an ordinary staff more magical. This has no significant effects, save to let people know the caster is a wizard. There will be an occasional entertaining effect from the staff, some visible only to other wizards. The effects are unlikely to distract the wielder overly.<br><br>

The spell is permanent, though there may be ways in which the spell can be broken.<br><br>

Ankhstones can be purchased from a stall on the Plaza of Broken Moons, or shops on Body Street and Treacle Street.<br><br>

<h3><a name="dwfpp">Doctor Worblehat's Flaming Primate Premonition</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 25<br>

<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Thee Secrets of Artifyce and Crafte<br>
<i>Methods</i>: turning, gold, enchanting, binding.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: Unknown.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Doctor Worblehat's Flaming Primate Premonition creates a flaming monkey, or more precisely, it creates a wooden monkey with certain magical properties. The resulting artifact is in the shape of a small wooden monkey with a cage containing a tiny red crystal. This artifact can then be lit and will provide a steady light source until it runs out of power or until it is extinguished. Once exhausted, it can be recharged with Rubayak's latest spell.<br><br>

The artifact will provide light for a very significant period, numbering in the hours, and must be carried by the user, as it cannot be worn or held. It weighs less than a pound.<br><br>

The rowan orb can be obtained from the Academy of Artificers, and the red crystals are one of the rhoksial crystals purchased together in a random assortment in a small bag from the Guild of Alchemists in Ankh-Morpork, from the IIL reagents store, or from the Academy of Artificers.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Reasonable Option<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Combined with Rubayak's Power Dispenser, this spell definitely represents a viable wizardly option to provide light to the user. With the significant duration combined with the small size of the recharging spell, this latest light spell may be the most practical.<br><br>

Ellamandyr's Hyaline Amulet turns a bowl of water into a piece of protective jewellery. It is currently unknown exactly what the delicate hyaline amulet protects against, however it has been suggested it may keep the wearer dry in the rain. Research continues.<br><br>

The spell is cast on the bowl (or other container) of water, with an easy source being the IIL fountain. Silver necklaces can be obtained from a number of jewellery stalls or shops, including those in the Divine Flower Market in Bes Pelargic, the Djelibeybi bazaar, The Royal Market Jewellers in Sto Lat or Rendtnor's in Ankh-Morpork.<br><br>

This spell allows the caster to identify a magical artefact, which must be done at least once before you can recharge an item of that type.<br><br>

In addition, the spell is useful to those with no interest in recharging to determine the amount of charges remaining in any magical artifact, provided the caster has enough skill to determine it. If the spell reports a number of charges, then that number is correct. If the caster is unsure of the weave, it indicates that, at least on that attempt, the caster's skills were insufficient.<br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>

<h3><a name="float">Finneblaugh's Thaumic Float</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 10<br>

<i>Location</i>: Begynners' Magick<br>
<i>Methods</i>: air, summoning, air.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 100, 110, 115.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Finneblaugh's is a spell that allows the caster to float several inches above the ground for the duration of the spell. With good skills, the duration may be up to twenty or thirty minutes, or a little less at guild-max. Casting the spell multiple times may extend this duration.<br><br>

Hovering does in fact turn out have several practical benefits. Firstly, while the spell is active at any rate, the caster will be able to hover on top of water, instead of sinking if they are heavily burdened. Note however, that the spell cannot be cast to hover above the water once one is already under it. In addition, some swimming skills will be needed to actually move across the water.<br><br>

It also may, and use only at your own risk, assist one in avoiding a large wizard shaped crater in the ground if one is falling from a great height. It may protect entirely from some heights, or only a limited amount from others.<br><br>

It will also be difficult for plants such as vines, no matter how quickly growing, to grab hold of and ensnare a wizard under the influence of this spell, as it is for grabbing hands.<br><br> 

Feathers can be of any sort and obtained from birds anywhere.<br><br>

<h3><a name="mir">Floron's Fabulous Mirror</a></h3>

<i>Methods</i>: channeling, divining, scrying.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 160, 160, 230.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Floron's gives the caster a split-second view of the area in which the target is. The target must be someone that can be uniquely referred to, or the spell will not be able to focus enough. Some targets may also be restricted to certain killer wizards.<br><br>

In addition to the scrying check when actually casting the spell, the caster will need to pass an additional skills contest between their scrying skill and a faith skill of the target. If the caster fails in this attempt, the target will be informed of the attempt, though not by whom, and the caster will not see the target.<br><br>

Simply failing the spell may cause the caster to hallucinate.<br><br>

There are a number of different mirrors available, including a silver mirror from Bligh Earcrusher's exclusive shop on Park Lane, Ankh-Morpork.<br><br>

<h3><a name="porter">Fyodor's Nimbus of Porterage</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 35<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 75<br>
<i>Components</i>: A candle, a towel (wet).<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Invoakatyons in thee Mysterie of Wynd<br>
<i>Methods</i>: water, fire, air, summoning, abjuring, channeling.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 120, 110, 135, 160, 130, 180.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Fyoder's summons a powerful cloud spirit to carry things for the caster. The spell is first cast at an object as the target, and the cloud will then appear to pick up said object. If at any point in its servitude it has nothing to carry, it will dissipate. Those with much to carry may summon multiple clouds.<br><br>

The total weight of items that the cloud may carry for its master depends on the skill of the caster, however the number of items the cloud can directly carry is limited to a double handful. If the cloud is to carry more, some sort of container must be used.<br><br>

When first summoning the cloud, the caster must share some of their intelligence and strength with it, usually between one and three points. They will of course regenerate with time, with the caster restored within a moderate timeframe depending on how much was lost.<br><br>

The cloud will survive until either it has nothing to carry, or the caster ceases to be present on the Disc. When that occurs, the cloud will simply drop everything it was carrying onto the ground for anyone to take. Casters of this spell should also be wary of thieves taking items from their cloud.<br><br>

The caster may 'order' the cloud to do a number of things, such as take or drop a particular item, return an object to the caster, and to follow. If the cloud is misplaced, it will eventually find its owner. If it seems distracted and no longer responding, the caster can 'poke' it to regain its attention.<br><br>

Neither the candle or towel are normally consumed by the spell, but the towel may burn if not sufficiently wet. Candles may be purchased in good light and other shops Disc wide, and there are number of sources of towels. To wet said towel, the caster can always dry themselves, if they happen to be wet, or they may be able to soak the towel in a fountain, such as that at the IIL.<br><br>

<h3><a name="tring">Gillimer's Ring of Temperate Weather</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 25<br>

<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>

<i>Methods</i>: gold, binding, enchanting, ring.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 240, 250, 230, 230.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Gillimer's creates a magical elegant ring, that when worn, helps to maintain the wearer's temperature from extremes of heat or cold. It is not perfectly efficient, with some of either getting through at far temperature ranges. <br><br>

The ring only protects a wearer for a limited amount of time, presumably dependent on the skills of the caster. Durations of up to 20 hours have been noted for wizards of some skill. It does not require any skills to be used, and can hence be provided to non-magic users. Once an elegant ring runs out of energy and no longer spins once worn, it can be recharged by casting the spell on it again. In this case, a new gold ring will not be required. Repeated castings on one ring may add to the duration of the spell, but research on exactly how much is ongoing.<br><br>

The spell can only be cast whilst in a forge. If you fail the spell, you may fall asleep for a period of time.<br><br>

<h3><a name="gryn">Gryntard's Feathery Reliever</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 25<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 60<br>
<i>Components</i>: A feather (consumed), a silver necklace.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Invoakatyons in thee Mysterie of Wynd<br>
<i>Methods</i>: summoning, air, binding, channeling.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 160, 190, 150, 190.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Gryntard's will temporarily reduce the weight of the item it is cast on. Both the reduction in weight, and the duration of the spell depend the caster's skills. At around guild maxed misc and reasonable methods, you can expect the spell to last around half an hour. Repeated casts will increase this, but with highly diminishing returns for each successive spell.<br><br>

The spell is limited to reducing the weight to a quarter of the original. If a single cast is not sufficient to reduce the weight to this limit, the spell can be cast again with further weight reduction. Skill may prevent you from reaching this limit however.<br><br>

This spell appears to be somewhat unique amongst spells with skills based results, in that the duration appears to be completely non-random for a single set of skills.<br><br>

Minor fails will sometimes occur, with only half the normal weight reduction. If the caster fails the spell entirely, the weight of the item will sometimes double.<br><br>

It is important to note that this spell will only reduce the weight of the target itself; it will not affect any of the items inside should the target be a container. This means that casting this spell on a five pound backpack which happens to weigh 40 pounds with all the items inside will only reduce the overall weight to around 37lb, not 10lb.<br><br>

The required necklace can be any type of silver necklace, not just the basic one. Any feather can be used, and items it is active on can be identified by the feathers present on the item.<br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Useful<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Gryntard's can be quite useful if you have low strength and carry around any heavy items. It also has a use in lightening the weight of weapons, allowing the user to attack faster, though reducing the damage of each hit.<br><br>

When cast upon an inanimate object, this spell causes the object to repeat, or 'speak' a message for a certain amount of time. The message that you set is limited in size, and you may use 'colourful' language if you wish.<br><br>

The spell only lasts for a relatively short duration, and you cannot cancel the spell by any means other than waiting for it to wear off.<br><br>

<h3><a name="port">Jogloran's Portal of Cheaper Travel</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 20<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 100<br>
<i>Components</i>: None.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Introeductyon too thee Strukture of thee Multyverss<br>
<i>Methods</i>: enchanting, evoking, binding, dancing, banishing.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 180, perhaps slightly higher banishing.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Jogloran's creates a portal between two places in a similar reality. This means that it will open a door between the place you are currently, and the place stored in the targeted rock or piece of jewellery. Note this is a one way trip only. Blorped targets will be dealt with in the spells that make them, <a href="#al">Al'Hrahaz's Scintillating Blorpler</a> and <a href="#sil">Amazing Silicate Blorpler</a> . <br><br>

While this spell is relatively easy, it tends to have a disproportionately high failure rate when compared to other spells, even at significantly higher than required bonuses. Presumably Jogloran did his best, but it is difficult to make Rictor's unreality factor behave itself. These failures and partial failures can take the form of one of the following:<br><br>

- Door fails to materialise; complete failurre of the spell.<br>
- Jewellery or rock having forgotten the loccation; failure of the spell, recast.<br>
- Doors wobbling immediately after they appeear; seems to be a random result, enter quickly.<br>
- Doors that rumble as soon as they appear;  these doors are waiting to explode, do not try to enter.<br>
- Burning doors; use at own risk. Opening, sshoving or entering these doors causes damage to the user.<br>
- Misportal; Partial failure of the spell. IInstead 
of the target location, the spell has sought out a random person and used them instead to anchor the other end of the door. Looking before entering is recommended.<br><br>


The jury is still out on what causes some of these results. Certain of them seem to be somewhat random, whereas others, such as misportals, seem to occur more frequently at low skill levels. The exact type of normal door that you get, such as a dirty piece of fur or a crystal door seems to be a random result of the unreality factor.<br><br>

Should everything go well, the caster simply opens the door and enters it. They should look before they do so, but it is not absolutely required. If they do not wish anyone to be able to follow them, they should push or shove the portal to destabilise it fairly quickly.<br><br>

There are a number of places where the thaumic fields prevent the caster from either portalling to or from. This usually occurs where the room has been protected by someone, such as secure locations like vaults or guild rooms.<br><br>

It is not unknown for this spell to kill a wizard, both directly, from burning or rumbling doors, and indirectly, by taking them to an incredibly dangerous locale. If one manages to get a door that is both burning and rumbling, a simple open, push and enter door may do up to 2,000 hit points damage to a user. Use with caution, but it is perfectly safe if appropriate care is taken.<br><br>

Portal, cast from scrolls, is also regrettably used by many non-wizards, and the sale of magic scrolls of such is a booming business.<br><br>

<h3><a name="glim">Master Glimer's Amazing Glowing Thing</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 30<br>

<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Master Glimer's allows the caster to enchant an item to a much greater extent than <a href="#enchant">Brother Happalon's Elementary Enchanting</a>, with it being possible to enchant an item until it radiates pure octarine brilliance.<br><br> 

It will however, take a number of casts to get to this level on most items. The number of casts taken will vary from caster to caster, depending on skills, but also on the item in question and the starting point. As a rough guide, a skilled caster will often enchant an item two or more stages of enchantment per spell, taking usually 3 or 4 casts from steady, with an extra if the item starts out only softly pulsing in dull octarine shades. The heavier the item, the more casts it is likely to require.<br><br>

This is one reason to enchant the item to as high as you can with the weaker enchanting spell, or even have it enchanted by a witch, who can often reach a steady octarine glow. Not only will this reduce the number of casts necessary, but it is actually required for an item to be at least partially enchanted before Master Glimer's can be cast.<br><br> 

The spell requires a thaumic funnel as a component, which can be made by casting <a href="#funnel">Objandeller's Thaumic Funnel</a>. Occasionally, the funnel will either disappear with a pop, fall to the ground, or turn into a caterpillar, particularly if an item is enchanted to thaumic overflow.<br><br> 

A full discussion of enchanting and how it effects the target items will be available in your  <a href="enchant.html" target="right">post-graduate studies on enchanting</a>.<br><br>

Purple mineral powder can be gained by pulverising purple mineral nuggets with a hammer. You can purchase the nuggets from the Guild of Alchemists in Ankh-Morpork, or the House of Magic in Creel Springs. Alternatively, purple mineral powder can sometimes be found flowing through the streams of Blue Moon Park in Bes Pelargic.<br><br>

<h3><a name="lumin">Master Woddeley's Luminescent Companion</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 10<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 15<br>
<i>Components</i>: None.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Cunjuryng for Begynners<br>
<i>Methods</i>: evoking, channeling, animating.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 100, 125, 135.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Master Woddeley's summons an animated ball of light which will follow the caster and allow them to see, whether at night, or underground. The duration of the spell is random, though of course increasing with skills, and users will have to cast this spell often at night. You can summon more than one, though there is a limit, but one is all that is necessary to see even in complete darkness. <br><br>

If you wish to get rid of the lights, perhaps to go to sleep, you can either cast <a href="#lumindisp">Duander's Thaumic Luminosity Disperser</a>, or you can simply shoo the light away.<br><br>

The spell is (mostly) non-corporeal, so area spells do not harm it. You will find it reacts violently to someone trying to kill it, usually because they've just been silly enough to attack all in the room. This has been known to kill the odd wizard who for whatever reason has forgotten they can shoo it away.<br><br>

If the spell is failed, it will often conjure up a ball of smoke that will cause anyone present to leave the room until it clears. This may also cause the caster some damage. There is in fact a recorded instance of a student killing themselves with spell, due to a large number of repeated failings without pause. Anyone slightly more intelligent than that student should have no problems.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Minimal<br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: This is an option for those who do not like the constant guild point drain of other light sources, or do not have the resources for a permanent light source.<br><br>



<h3><a name="mask">Myrandil's Mask of Death</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 10<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 30<br>

<i>Location</i>: Ae Thouesand and Onne Thyngs ae Boye cann Do with Corpse Partes<br>
<i>Methods</i>: enchanting, healing, summoning, binding, abjuring.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 125, 130, 140, 150, 150.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This spell is for those who wish to lose their heads. It will make the caster look like a zombie which has seen better days. For instance, worms will seem to inhabit the spaces of your head, and pop out to say Hi to those in the vicinity. The effects are many and quite fun. The duration will increase with the caster's skill.<br><br>

<h3><a name="hand">Narquin's Hand of Acquisition</a></h3>

<i>Components</i>: A hand (consumed).<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Ae Thouesand and Onne Thyngs ae Boye cann Do with Corpse Partes<br>
<i>Methods</i>: convoking, healing, animating.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 150, 130, 160.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

The spell allows a caster to animate a dead hand and use it to grab items from adjacent rooms. Once the caster moves, the opportunity is lost.<br><br>

It might prove useful to allow a wizard to grab items from a dangerous room, or perhaps to retrieve a fallen shield from another room that the caster does not wish to re-enter.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: East<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Pointless<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: While there may be one or two situations where it could be useful, the sheer size of the spell makes it pointless to carry regularly.<br><br>



<h3><a name="funnel">Objandeller's Thaumic Funnel</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 15<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 15<br>
<i>Components</i>: None.<br>

<i>Methods</i>: water, channeling, dancing, binding.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 120, 130, 120, 120.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This spell creates a thaumic funnel for use in <a href="#enchant">Brother Happalon's Elementary Enchanting</a> or <a href="#glim">Master Glimer's Amazing Glowing Thing</a>.<br><br>

Thaumic funnels have recently come onto the market and are now sold in the House of Magic in Creel Springs and from the IIL reagents store.<br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Reasonable Option<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Obviously, one needs a thaumic funnel to enchant. So you can either carry this spell, use it to stock a few up in storage, or perhaps you can skip it altogether and buy them these days.<br><br>



<h3><a name="ptqwb">Patient Taming of the Quantum Weather Butterfly</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 50<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 85<br>
<i>Components</i>: Requires the focus of an octogram.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Heavenly Arts<br>
<i>Methods</i>: water, earth, air, fire, binding.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 200, 220, 300, 300, 340.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This spell allows the caster to summon the powers of the Quantum Weather Butterfly. When doing so, the caster chooses between warming or cooling the location that they are in. The spell however, can only be cast outdoors.<br><br>

The resulting temperature of the room will depend both on the skills of the casting wizard, but also the original ambient temperature. I.e. it will be far colder in a location if the cooling side of the spell is cast in a room already chilly than if it is hot.<br><br>

Users can therefore use it in opposition to the ambient to try and make the temperature closer to a comfortable average, or to quickly cool down or warm up if they enhance an already cool or warm room. The results of the spell will be visible for all to see, and the spell lasts around 10-15 minutes with moderately high skills.<br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: High<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Quite Fun<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: The sheer artistry of the spell's original creator is a delight to behold; sure to amaze, delight and either freeze or roast others. A lot of fun to cast in high traffic areas.<br><br>



<h3><a name="ppp">Polliwiggle's Puissancy Probe</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 10<br>

<i>Location</i>: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Everything<br>
<i>Methods</i>: divining, divining.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 100.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This spell simply allows a caster to probe a target to judge their magical powers. It will only give a very general message, for example; From the flows of magic, you guess that yournamehere is amazingly puissant.<br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Student<br>

<h3><a name="grimamulet">Professor Flambardie's Grim Amulet</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 50<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 200<br>
<i>Components</i>: A silver medallion (consumed), a small green crystal (consumed), and a wand.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: My Firste Demon-Summoning Booke!<br>
<i>Methods</i>: amulet, water, wand, summoning, binding.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 150, 230, 230, 250, 260.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Professor Flambardie's spell creates a protective amulet to use in certain demon summoning spells. The exact extent of this protection is not fully understood at present, but the amulet certainly must be worn for any benefit to materialise. In addition, the amulet is required at present to even convince demons to respond at all.<br><br>

The twisted black amulets created seem to be somewhat delicate, and melt when used in enough spells, enough being quite random. The high size and guild point cost means you'll want to create a stock of amulets and then forget the spell.<br><br>

A failure in the spell will mean the appearance of a demon in corporeal form, rather than an amulet.<br><br>

The small green crystals are one of the rhoksial crystals purchased together in a random assortment in a small bag from the Guild of Alchemists in Ankh-Morpork, from the IIL reagents store, or from the Academy of Artificers. Silver medallions can be purchased at Rendtnor's Jewellery Shop in the Plaza of Broken Moons, Ankh-Morpork, the Royal Market Jewellers in Sto Lat, or from the jewellery stall in the northwest corner of the Divine Flower marketplace, Bes Pelargic. They can often also be obtained from the cold dead necks of some mean mercenaries and other beings similarly impressed with themselves.<br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Moderate<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Minimal<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Reasonable Option<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: You either have to have this spell, or pay someone else for the results, if you wish to use <a href="spells1.html#dkdd">Doctor Kelleflump's</a>. Well, also if you wish to use its <a href="spells1.html#kid">little brother</a> I suppose, but it hardly seems worth the effort. Otherwise, you won't need this spell.<br><br>



<h3><a name="rpd">Rubayak's Power Dispenser</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 5<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 20<br>
<i>Components</i>: A red crystal (consumed), a banana (consumed), a wooden monkey.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Thee Secrets of Artifyce and Crafte<br>
<i>Methods</i>: enchanting, channeling, binding.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: Below 100.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Rubayak's Power Dispenser is an adjunct to Doctor Worblehat's Flaming Primate Premonition, and somehow feeds the banana to the wooden monkey created by said spell and the energies of the red crystal into the power source already included in the monkey. It is expected that this recharges or extends the duration of the light emitted by the crystal.
<br><br>

Research continues into the duration and other effects of the monkey. The monkey can be used by anyone and can be lit or extinguished as necessary.<br><br>

The red crystals are one of the rhoksial crystals purchased together in a random assortment in a small bag from the Guild of Alchemists in Ankh-Morpork, from the IIL reagents store, or from the Academy of Artificers.<br><br> 

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Student<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Reasonable Option<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: This spell, especially given its small size represents an effective method of recharging another wizardly light source on an ongoing basis.<br><br>



<h3><a name="pstore">Rubayak's Power Storage</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 30<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 40<br>
<i>Components</i>: A black shell.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Introeductyon too thee Strukture of thee Multyverss<br>
<i>Methods</i>: binding, channeling, enchanting, enchanting.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 110, 200, 140, 200.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Rubayak's allows a wizard to store power, or guild points, into a spiral of containment for later use in recharging magical artifacts. The spell will drain all of your remaining guild points after casting the spell, with how well that power is stored depending on your skill.<br><br>

You cannot use the power in the shell for anything other than recharging. Repeated casts can be made on the same shell, with additional powder added to it each time. Exactly how much can be placed in the shell may be limited by skills.<br><br>

When using the shell to recharge anything it is consumed, and all of the power used. You cannot selectively use a portion of the stored power.<br><br>

The spiral of containment is the black sea shell which can be purchased from the House of Magic, Creel Springs or the High Tide covered market in Bes Pelargic for the equivalent of $2.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Moderate<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Minimal<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Pointless<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: If you are into recharging and have thousands upon thousands of useless guild points to burn, this may be for you! May even get a few points increases out of it. Or, you could go and spend time getting free purple mineral powder to recharge if money is the problem.<br><br>



<h3><a name="scrib">Scolorid's Scintillating Scribbling</a></h3>

<i>Methods</i>: evoking, binding, convoking, enchanting.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 120, 125, 130, 140.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This spell writes a message specified by the caster on the target in octarine colours in the language of wizard spells. This means that it can only be read by wizards, though witches can at least see that something is there. The amount of characters is limited to 88.<br><br>

If the spell is cast a second time on an item, the new message is added below the current one. The resulting scribbling can be removed using certain services or items.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Reasonable Option<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Most often used to write the location of blorps on the item in question to solve later memory lapses.<br><br>

 

<h3><a name="cfates">Thousand Dancing Celestial Fates</a></h3>

<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Advanced Arts and Sciences of the Cunning Artificer<br>
<i>Methods</i>: dancing, turning, whittling, enchanting, binding.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: Around 150 for the first three, 170 for the others.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Thousand Dancing Celestial Fates calls into existence a charm of incredible power. The spell must be cast on someone else, as the caster already knows how charming they are!<br><br>

The charm that is created is made for one person only, and will be crafted as such. The charm will change itself to become each of the animals of the Agatean zodiac and occasionally make its presence felt.<br><br>

Those who gaze into such a charm may find themselves in an even more magical world!<br><br>

The sliver of octarine can be purchased from George Boots-San in the Bes Pelargic guild, or from the House of Magic in Creel Springs.<br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: <br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Quite Fun<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Well, the fun is mostly for the recipient in this one, not the caster. Try it for yourself, the amulets make a wonderful gift!<br><br>



<h3><a name="illusion">Torqvald's Illusion Generatrix</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 35<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 100<br>
<i>Components</i>: A quill, silver ring, an end (all consumed), and a small bucket.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Cunjuryng for Begynners<br>
<i>Methods</i>: air, binding, conjuring, charming, channeling, conjuring, charming.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 230, 240, 230, 210, 250, 230, 270.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This spell allows the caster to envisage an area illusion, creating a completely new and hitherto unknown spell in their mind that will activate the
 illusion when cast. The size of the illusion that can be created is based on the skills of the caster.<br><br>

The illusion can be in colour if the caster wishes, and blanks are used to separate spell stages in the illusion. Once the illusion has been developed, a new spell with a random name will appear in their memory, and all of the usual actions can be taken with it.<br><br>

Most wizards feel inclined to use their artistic streak with this spell to convince onlookers that something astounding has taken place.<br><br>

You can buy quills at many different legibles stores Disc wide for around $2.50, including the shop in the Magical Supplies Emporium just across from the UU. Silver rings are available at a number of jewellers, while the ends can be purchased at the Get 'em While You Can shop in the Plaza of Broken Moons. A small bucket can be purchased from the IIL reagents store, a bucket store on Long Street, Bes Pelargic and a similar store on Kings Down, Ankh-Morpork.<br><br>


Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Moderate<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Toy Spell<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Probably the ultimate Toy Spell, since it can create even more Toy Spells of the caster's own design!<br><br>

<i>Methods</i>: air, channeling, charming.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 80, 100, 110.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Torqvald's Many Colours simply causes the caster's skin to appear to randomly change colours. Not only will this brighten your description, but everyone will notice when you change colour! The spell is active for only a limited duration.<br><br>

<h3><a name="tea">Turnwhistle's Effulgent Autiridescence</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 10<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 150<br>
<i>Components</i>: A shimmering glass nugget (consumed), a lantern. Requires an octogram.<br>
<i>Order of spell</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Location</i>: Intermediate Artifact Magic, fourth ed.<br>
<i>Methods</i>: divining, evoking, binding.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 175, 210, 210.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Turnwhistle's Effulgent Autiridescence allows the skilled Wizard to imbue a garment or accoutrement with the priceless gift of light in dark places. Said garment or accoutrement will maintain its light by leeching the wearer's concentration a little from time to time, that is, consuming around one guild point per heartbeat.<br><br>

If the caster no longer wishes the item to provide light, then Skeetbraskin's Fuliginous Perdition can be used to remove it.<br><br>

The glass nugget can be purchased from George Boots-San in the Bes Pelargic guild.<br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Moderate<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Unclassified<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Reasonable Option<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: There are some who still like, or need, to use yellow stone rings to provide light. This gives them a far more stylish and exclusive option.<br><br>



<h3><a name="updd">Union of the Phoenix and Divine Dragon</a></h3>

<i>Spell size</i>: 25<br>
<i>Guild point cost</i>: 50<br>
<i>Components</i>: A glass nugget.<br>

<i>Location</i>: Illusionary Arts<br>
<i>Methods</i>: channeling, summoning, charming.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 170, 180, 210.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This spell will summon forth a glowing moth. It will heartily stay by your side until it's summoned elsewhere. Like Master Woddeley's, this spell summons a light source for the caster to see anywhere by.<br><br>

As with that spell, the moth will last a certain period, again based on caster skills, and it can be shooed away if it becomes a nuisance. The spell can also be cast on others.<br><br>

The glass nugget can be purchased from George Boots-San in the Bes Pelargic guild.<br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Minimal<br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: An Agatean alternative to <a href="#lumin">Master Woddeley's Luminescent Companion</a>, it does take up a little more mind space however.<br><br>



<h3><a name="wamg">Worstler's Advanced Metallurgical Glance</a></h3>

<i>Methods</i>: animating, divining, scrying.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 50, 90, 100.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Like the other spell discovered by Worstler, the spell simply scries the location where a blorped item will take you to, but in this case, on a piece of jewellery.<br><br>

The spell really has only limited use, as unlike rocks or pebbles, jewellery will rarely disappear if it simply used to find its encoded location. Some however, do use this spell to scry locations without there being anyone, or someone unscryable, present.<br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Student<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Reasonable Option<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Use if you're interested in checking particular locations regularly, otherwise, just cast Jogloran's.<br><br>

<i>Location</i>: Begynners' Magick<br>
<i>Methods</i>: earth, evoking, scrying.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 40, 55, 90.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

Worstler's Elementary Mineralogical Glance uses the blorpled rock, stone, cobble or pebble at which it is cast to scry the encoded location.<br><br>

You can use this to check the location of your blorp if you have forgotten, or, it may be used as a scrying tool for particular locations.<br><br> 

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Student<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Reasonable Option<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Being even smaller than the Metallurgical version, this spell has real potential for scrying your favourite spots.<br><br>

<i>Methods</i>: channeling, evoking, convoking.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 150, 160, 160.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This is a spell designed to help tide wizards over between lunch and dinner.  It will create small snacks for the caster to nibble on as they wander around thinking about important things like the dinner menu. It also allows said wizard to create a nice full bucket of alcohol to wash down the light snacks.<br><br>

If the wizard casts the spell without thinking of anything in particular, the spell will provide them with a menu to choose from. They can select a number of items from the menu all at once, great for the big eaters. You do of course need a container to summon liquid into.<br><br>

<i>Methods</i>: channeling, convoking, evoking, binding, animating.<br>
<i>Required bonuses</i>: 120 for the first three, 140, 150.<br>
<i>Spell details</i>:<br><br>

This is the non permanent version of <a href="#booch">Booch's Extremal Polymorphism</a>. The duration of the caster's new arm is based on their skills. Be sure to pick up anything the extra arms were holding when they drop off.<br><br>

The advantage of this spell compared to Booch's is that under this version, only the new arm is at risk of being cut from the body. <br><br>

Sekiri's Ratings:<br>
<i>Difficulty</i>: Easy<br>
<i>Mortality Rating</i>: Harmless<br>
<i>Overall</i>: Reasonable Option<br><br>

<i>Final thoughts</i>: Obvious advantages to offset the fact that this spell is only temporary. If you want an extra arm, you'll need to decide which spell works for you.<br><br>
