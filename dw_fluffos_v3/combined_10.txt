=== Content from Meditate ===

Anyone can learn meditate at the top of the tower of the gods in [[Bes Pelargic]].
*There is a [[Guild Level]] requirement of somewhere between GL 40 and GL 50
*For Sek at least, this is confirmed to be at GL 40.

==Meditate==
First, using "meditate" by itself will erase all rituals from your mind and most faith commands.  You will then need to visit a religious instructor to get them back.
*This only works for [[priests]] and [[followers]] who worship a deity.
*This does not seem to have a skillcheck.

==Meditate [upon] [my] remove divine protection==
Cripsi added this syntax to allow removing the divine protection you have.
*This does not remove beneficial rituals like [[Bless]].
*This works for all, including [[witches]]Â and [[wizards]] if they learn the command.

==Meditate [on] obsecration==
The "meditate [on] obsecration" syntax can give you details about the [[deity pool]], as well as your recent interactions with it.
*This only works for [[priests]] and [[followers]] who worship a deity.
*This costs 100 faith points and adds 5 deity points to the pool (whether or not you succeed).
*It uses the [[faith.items.scroll]] skill. Try 180 bonus and aim for 200 to succeed reliably.
*It behaves as if you're unconscious during a meditation (note that can you 'stop' mid meditation if you want to).
*It adds 5 [[deity points]] to your god's deity pool, unless you are excommunicated.

First, you're told how full the deity pool is.  From fullest to least full, these are the possible results:
*at its maximum capacity
*nearly totally full
*only slightly depleted
*in good supply
*roughly half-full (or half-empty, depending on how you like to look at things) 
*less than half full
*running dangerously low
*almost run out
*totally exhausted

Next, you'll get details of your interactions with the pool over the past few weeks.  For the current week, the previous week, and the week before that, you'll see how many deity points you contributed or drained from the pool, and how many you ''would'' have contributed if it had not been full.  If you didn't interact with the pool for one of those weeks, it will be left out.

If you haven't interacted with the pool at all during that time period, you get this message instead:
&lt;pre>There is no record of &lt;your name> interacting with the deity pool over the last few weeks.&lt;/pre>

If any rituals have been made profane, there will be a line about this, as well:
&lt;pre>You learn that summon fluff and splash are considered profane by Seven-Handed Sek.&lt;/pre>
This means that you can't use them from [[faith rods]].

==Meditate {upon} ritual==
A Fourth syntax, "meditate {upon} &lt;ritual>", gives you some limited information about the ritual you're meditating on.
*This only works for [[priests]] and [[followers]] who worship a deity.
*It costs a varying amount of gp.
*It uses [[faith.rituals.special]], [[faith.items.scroll]], and the skill or skills that the ritual uses.

If it says you emerge with "some insights", that's a full success, and you've gotten all the information about that ritual that meditate will give you.  This information is:
*The type of ritual it is (offensive, defensive, miscellaneous, or healing)
*How many steps it has
*Who or what, if anything, it can be performed on
*Any components it requires
*Any powers it requires ([[speech]], [[movement]], and/or [[sight]])
*Whether the target will resist it (if targetted)

If it says you gain "some knowledge", then you received incomplete information.

If it just says that you "do not manage to stay in your meditative state", then that's a failure.

If it says that meditating "leaves you wondering how to perform [the ritual] at all", then you forget the ritual completely and will need to visit an instructor to learn it again.

==Meditate {over} object==
The final syntax, "meditate {over} &lt;object>", gives you faith-related information about an object.  This takes 100 gp, and uses the [[faith.rituals.special]] skill.
*This only works for [[priests]] and [[followers]] who worship a deity.

If successful, you are told, in order:
*Whether it has been [[consecrate]]d, and if so, to which deity.
*Whether it is [[remember place|remembering]] any places, and if so, where and for whom.
*Whether it is any of the following: a [[holy relic]], a [[holy symbol]], a [[holy amulet]] and/or a set of [[prayer beads]].  (Sufficiently charged prayer beads are all of these.)
*If it has been [[ward]]ed, then which rituals it was warded with, and the deity of the priest who warded it.

If it's unconsecrated, you just get this message:
&lt;pre>The elegant McSweeney tartan tie has no religious significance for you.&lt;/pre>
