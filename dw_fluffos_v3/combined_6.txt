=== Content from Dodge ===
'''Dodging''' is the means of defence by which an the defender avoids an incoming physical attack by moving out of the way.

==Applicability==
Dodging can only be used to avoid ''physical'' attacks, thus it is useless against magic.

Dodging can be used to avoid either a melee attack or a ranged attack; if successfully executed then the defender takes no damage.

In order to dodge, [[Tactics#Response|tactics-response]] must be set to either 'neutral' or 'dodge'.

==Mechanics==
There are two factors associated with dodging:
*How likely is an incoming attack to be dodged?
*How many [[action points]] does dodging an attack cost?

These are addressed below:

===Chance of dodging===
A character's basic chance of dodging an incoming attack is determined by a skillcheck of their [[fighting.defence.dodging]] skill against the relevant weapon skill of the attacker (eg. [[fighting.melee.sword]] or [[fighting.range.thrown]]).

This chance is then modified by the following factors specific to the defender's dodging&lt;ref>Note: Other bonuses and penalties also apply; this article only discusses ones directly related to dodging.&lt;/ref>:
*There is a penalty to dodging in direct proportion to the degree of [[burden]] of the defender. It's hard to leap out of the way of an attack in time when you're lugging a lot of equipment about. 
*Additionally, there is a ''further penalty'' based on [[burden]] if your [[burden]] level is more than twice your [[dexterity]] stat.  This is a considerably more dramatically increasing penalty than the one above, and is best avoided.
*There is a minor bonus to dodging proportional to the weight of the attacker's weapon (heavier weapons are slower, thus easier to dodge).

===Action point cost===
The [[action points|action point]] cost of dodging starts at a constant base level, and is then modified as follows:
*The cost is reduced with higher skills in [[fighting.defence.dodging]] and [[fighting.special.tactics]].
*There is a diminishing-returns penalty based on the [[burden]] of the dodger (the more burdened you are, the more momentum you need to overcome after dodging).

==Somehow avoid==
If a defender does not have enough [[action points]] to dodge, but their dodging bonus is significantly higher than an attacker's melee bonus, they might somehow avoid the attack anyway.
&lt;pre>You slice at the huge whirlwind of ice with your steel naginata but, although unable to defend, it somehow avoids the attack.&lt;/pre>
This effectively results in a defence that costs no action points. By using an insane [[Tactics#Attitude|tactics-attitude]], a player with a sufficiently high dodging bonus may spend all of their action points on attacking but still somehow avoid attacks.

Somehow avoiding is unique to having a high [[fighting.defence.dodging]] bonus. [[Fighting.defence.parrying]] and [[fighting.defence.blocking]] do not have this benefit. Note that you may somehow avoid even if you use a [[Tactics#Response|tactics-response]] of parry or block.

On 15 Oct '21, Pit posted on a discussion about somehow avoid to say that this is essentially a bug, but that he was reticent to fix it for reasons:

&lt;pre> The existence of somehow avoids *is* a bug, and it's even trivially easy to fix (it's a 5-letter fix; I almost did it just as a routine fix before someone informed me that doing so would kill off half the playerbase). You don't lightly change a feature that players have built their playstyle around. &lt;/pre>

On [[Announcements#a_slight_change_to_combat_.28Oct_18.29|18 Oct 2021]], the odds to "somehow avoid" was reduced by 5%, reportedly it was 100% before if you had a much higher dodge bonus against your opponent's attack skill bonus.

==Spellcasting==
For the duration of [[magic|spellcasting]] or [[hedgehog]], the caster will attempt to dodge, parry or block incoming attacks as their settings specify in their [[Tactics#Response|tactics-response]]. Their chance of defending successfully is reduced, and they do not recover [[action points]] while casting.

==Defend and riposte==
[[Defend]] and [[riposte]] are incompatible with dodging; if a player's response is set to 'dodge', they will be unable to perform either of these actions.

'''Dust Devil''' is a [[Priests' Guild|priest]] [[ritual]] that summons a dust devil, a type of [[minion]] that assists you in combat.

==Performing==
This ritual is not performed on anything, and costs 50 gp if you're not controlling any minions already.  If you are controlling other minions, it costs an extra 25 gp per minion you're controlling.

It requires the powers of [[speech]] and [[movement]].

===Skills===
This ritual uses [[faith.rituals.misc.area]] (in the first stage) and [[faith.rituals.offensive.area]] (in the second stage).  Both skills affect the size, hitpoints, and offensive abilities of the devils.  Devils' defensive abilities seem to be constant.

Both skills affect the number you can summon, and the two stages seem to be of similar difficulty in this regard.

===Components===
*[[holy symbol]]

===Performing messages===
'''Performing'''
&lt;pre>You raise your hands, and swirl them about.
You speak the holy word of Sandelfon.
&lt;/pre>

'''Success'''
&lt;pre>The wind picks up a bit and starts swirling.  Dust and debris in the area come together to form a colossal whirlwind of dust.&lt;/pre>

'''Failure'''
&lt;pre>You try to gain control of a dust devil but the necessary concentration eludes you.&lt;/pre>

At failure, you'll lose the dust devils you had so far:

&lt;pre>The additional strain overwhelms you and a gigantic whirlwind of dust, a humongous whirlwind of rubbish, two unbelievably large whirlwinds of dust and an unbelievably large whirlwind of rubbish slip away from your control.&lt;/pre>

'''What others see'''
&lt;pre>
&lt;/pre>
{{Ritual details needed}}

==Dust devils==
Dust devils will assist you in combat, attacking whatever you attack.  Killing while using a dust devil will somewhat reduce the xp you get from killing.

The material they're composed of varies widely, and depends on where they're summoned (and possibly the weather where they're summoned).  Devils made of certain materials can have different-looking attacks, although it's not clear whether these do a different amount of damage than normal attacks.{{Research}}

===Sizes===
Dust devil size seems to be a rough indicator of offensive abilities and/or hitpoints.
#Tiny
#Small
#Average
#Large
#Huge
#Gigantic
#Colossal
#Enormous
#Humongous
#Unbelievably large

If you summon multiple devils, their size goes down as you summon more.

===Duration===
A dust devil tends to last from around [[Research:Dust_Devil#Duration|five to seven minutes or so]], if it's not dismissed or killed.  This appears to depend on your [[faith.rituals.offensive.area]] bonus, as well as how many minions you're already controlling.

You can extend this duration by feeding them enough gp at once:
&lt;pre>Forms of syntax available for the command 'feed':
feed &lt;positive number> {gp|gps|guild points} [to] &lt;minion> 
feed &lt;minion> fully &lt;/pre>

===Leaving===
It looks like this when they leave:
&lt;pre>
The &lt;size> whirlwind of &lt;material> slows its twirling as it prepares to depart.
[several seconds pass]
The &lt;size> whirlwind of &lt;material> says to you: It is time forr me to go.
The &lt;size> whirlwind of &lt;material> dissipates into nothingness.&lt;/pre>

===Number===
If you are already controlling a dust devil and try to summon another one, there is a skillcheck at each stage of the ritual: misc.area for the first stage, and offensive.area for the second stage.  If you fail either skillcheck, the dust devils you're already controlling will dissipate.  These skillchecks seem to be similar in difficulty, and get harder the more dust devils you're controlling.

As a rough guide, with no other ritual modifiers and controlling ''only'' dust devils:
*Bonuses of 204 in both skills let you succeed at summoning at least one dust devil about 83% of the time, and summon a second devil about 13% of the time.
*Bonuses of 250 let you summon at least one dust devil about 98% of the time, at least two dust devils about 94% of the time, and a third dust devil about 4% of the time.
*Bonuses of 270 let you summon at least one dust devil about 100% of the time, at least two dust devils about 89% of the time, and a third dust devil about 27% of the time.
*Bonuses of 302-303 let you summon at least one dust devil about 100% of the time, at least two dust devils about 96% of the time, and a third dust devil about 69% of the time.
*Bonuses of 349-350 let you summon at least two dust devils about 100% of the time, at least three dust devils about 99% of the time, and a fourth dust devil about 6% of the time.

Controlling other minions also makes it harder to summon additional dust devils, but there is no data on whether the effect is different depending on what type or types of minions you're controlling.{{Research}}

===Commanding===
 ask &lt;devil> [to] unassist [me]                                            
 ask &lt;devil> [to] follow                                                   
 ask &lt;devil> [to] {kill|attack} &lt;creature>                                 
 ask &lt;devil> [to] assist [me]                                              
 ask &lt;devil> [to] leave                                                    
 ask &lt;devil> [to] focus on &lt;creature>   

==Wards==
When the ward is triggered, a dust devil is summoned.  The devil follows and will obey the victim.

=== Content from Emote ===

Both commands are available to all players but must first be acquired from [[quests]].

==Getting fancy==
===Multiple remote/tell===
When you want to '''remote''' or '''tell''' to multiple people at once, you group their names with a comma and ''no space''.

 > remote amaranth,pterrific sighs happily as she sips her tea with such lovely ladies.
 You remote to Amaranth LeZatapathique and Pterrific pteh Pterrible: Emily von Schaf sighs happily as she sips her tea with such lovely ladies.

===Moving your name away from the start===
For both '''emote''' and '''remote''', if you put the text $me$ into the text, instead of prepending your name all instances of $me$ will be replaced by your name.

 > emote Belle Starr nuzzle's $me$'s pockets looking for hay.
 You emote: Belle Starr nuzzle's Emily von Schaf's pockets looking for hay. (Emily)

If you want this in an alias, however, you must escape the $s with \ (backslash),
 
 alias emo-hnuz emote Belle Starr nuzzle's \$me\$'s pockets looking for hay.

N.B. Your name is appended in parentheses to confirm the source and avoid spoofing.

 remote ama,pter Death walks in and points his finger first at Pterrific pteh Pterrible, then at $me$, and lastly at Amaranth LeZatapathique. 
 You remote to Pterrific pteh Pterrible and Amaranth LeZatapathique: Death walks in and points his finger first at Pterrific pteh Pterrible, then at Emily von Schaf, and lastly at Amaranth LeZatapathique. (Emily)

===Possessive apostrophe===
If you do not need to move your name from the front of the r/emote but wish to use the possesive form of your name you can use a space and apostrophe and the mud is smart enough to concatenate it correctly.

 > remote pterrific,amaranth 's horse is so mischievous.
 You remote to Amaranth LeZatapathique and Pterrific pteh Pterrible: Emily von Schaf's horse is so mischievous.

 > emote 's hand goes up.
 You emote: Emily von Schaf's hand goes up.

&lt;/pre>

=== Effects ===

;When looking at the shielded person
It adds the following line into the description
{{Prebox|He has a &lt;shield> floating around &lt;him/her>.}}
;When in combat
Caster is unable to use melee defenses (dodge, parry, block) while the shield is active.  Defense against fighting specials such as shove and trip (fi.de.** skillcheck) is not affected.

==Effectiveness==
Shields with the exact same weight will perform the same, except for the damage it takes. As a shield absorb hits, it will get damaged as shown by its [[condition]]. Better materials such as klatchian steel and octiron will take more hits to get to a damaged condition than other materials. This could be because the material takes less damage with each hit and/or that better materials give items more health.

A shield is harder to float and harder to control (make it block hits) when it is heavier, but its resistance to being knocked down when it absorbs hits is greater.

If your [[magic.methods.physical.binding]] bonus is too low you will fail more often at initially making a shield of a given weight float around you. However this will not help block more hits. You can try again by casting the spell until it succeeds or you run out of [[GP]]. However, just because you can make the shield float around you does not mean it will block attacks.

If your [[magic.spells.defensive]] bonus is too low a shield of a given weight will fail to block attacks, but you will not attempt to [[dodge]] or [[parry]], you will just get hit. You can try with a lighter shield (though it will be knocked down more easily) or you can increase your defensive bonus. As your bonus increase it will block a greater percentage of attacks (averaged over a long time), though any given attack can still randomly fail and you could have several such failures in a row. This can happen at the same time as bursts of lag which can result in your [[death]]. Having more layers of protection like [[CCC]], [[dodge]]/[[parry]]/[[block]] or [[armour]] is recommended.

The resistance of a shield to getting knocked down when blocking a hit is greater for heavier shields, i.e. a large wall shield will be much harder to knock down than a small wooden shield. The formula for this is: Knockdown resistance = (weight of current shield/weight of baseline shield)^(log2 10). However it is much harder to make a heavy shield block attacks than with a light one.

;In combat - too late
{{Prebox|Your &lt;shield> is too late to block the &lt;opponent>'s attack.}}

;Knocked out of orbit

{{Prebox|In blocking the attack the &lt;shield> floating around you is knocked out of orbit.}}

;When it falls as you leave the room
{{Prebox| You realise that the &lt;shield> is no longer floating around you.}}

=== Shield List ===

Below is a list of shields and the bonuses suggested using a formula derived from information inside QuowEFFStats.xml from the [[User:Quow|Quow]]'s [https://quow.co.uk/eff.php EFF plugin].

Knockdown resistance values are also included, using the small leather shield as a baseline - e.g. a Ephebian round shield with a resistance of 13 is 13 times less likely to fall to the same attack compared to a small leather shield, and in turn a medium bone shield is 26 times less likely to fall compared to the same small leather shield, etc.

* Note that bronze and copper shields have very low durability, and can need repairing extremely frequently if you hunt a lot - the large copper wall shield particularly can lose almost half it's durability in just an hour.
* While the repair prices for the Ug Ogg shields is high at first, with repeated repairings the value of the shield itself will drop, lowering the repair costs over a long period.
* The shield weights were reduced on July 9th 2017, but the "EFF spell is unaffected". {{Devblog|681}}

The weight of custom shields varies according to size, material and quality. The following table gives approximate weights for the various combinations.

=== Custom Shields ===

These shields can be ordered at [[Ug Ogg]]'s Custom armour shop in the Djelian Guard Guildhouse, Djelibeybi. It can be found at the north-east end of Djelibeybi near the Palace. The weights of the various combination of shield, materials and qualities are as follows.

Please note that there are three categories of shield types (by name) for the same quality that have the same weight and the same price. For copper, from lightest to heaviest:
# The large '''buckler&lt;ref name="buckler"/>''' and the large diamond/targe/circle/disc/round/two star/(no qualifier)/square shields weigh 10 lb.
# The large '''aegis&lt;ref name="aegis"/>'''/kite/teardrop/oval/heater/three star/rectangular/scutum/tower shields weigh 11 lb.
# The large '''wall''' shield weighs 15.

The cheapest option for groups of the same weight are:
*bone
*stone
*copper

==Notes==
* As well as being hit by strong melee attacks, a floating shield can be knocked out of orbit using the spell [[Frygellhan's Fiendish Orbit Disruptor]]. This is useful if you need to retrieve a shield from orbit without entering combat. Note that casting this spell on an NPC wizard using EFF will initiate combat, and the spell is pk-checked when cast on other players.
* [[Mother Brynda's Call of Gravity]] can also be used by witches to de-orbit shields.
* Shields while in orbit cannot be used to cast [[Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator]].
* When two or more shields are active there is a strong preference for the new shield to be knocked down, but it does have a chance to knock down the existing shield based on how much heavier the new shield is.

==Gaining experience points==
There exist many ways by which experience points can be gained:

===Kill and burial XP===
Kill XP is earned when a player kills an enemy, and burial XP is awarded when the corpse is buried.  The amount of XP rewarded increases in relation to the 'difficulty' of the target killed.

Note that:
*You can only get burial XP ''once'' per victim - recovering the corpse and re-burying it does not award further XP.
*You can only get burial XP within five minutes of the npc dying.  Corpses buried after this time give no XP.
*Even when npcs seem identical, they often give different amounts of kill and burial XP.  E.g. three farmers in the melon farms outside [[Djelibeybi]] will give three different amounts of XP.
*Npcs that don't leave behind corpses--such as zombies, vampires, mommets, eggplants--seem to just give kill xp.

Kill and burial XP are related, but work somewhat differently.  Kill XP appears to start out the same as the burial XP, but it's adjusted downwards in a few ways that burial XP is not:
*If the victor is of higher [[guild level]] than the victim, then the XP is scaled down according to the ratio of their levels (eg. a level 200 player killing a level 100 victim only gets half the XP that a level 100 player killing the same victim would).
*The XP is scaled down in proportion to the victor's [[wimpy]] level (so a wimpy of 10% results in 90% of the XP being awarded, for example).
*If the victor's XP rate is over 100,000 XP/hour, kill XP is scaled down, apparently according to the ratio of 100,000 to your rate (so that when your rate is 200,000 XP/hour, you'll get half the kill XP you normally would, and when it's 500,000 XP/hour, you'll get a fifth).
*If the npc is in combat with you, but you are not actually in the room when it dies, you only get half of "your share" ("your share" being the amount you would have gotten if you had been in the room when it died and not grouped with other combatants) of the kill xp.

Burial XP, on the other hand, is only penalized when your hourly rate reaches 500,000 xp/hour (as with most types of xp), apparently according to the ratio of 500,000 to your rate.  Also, unlike with kill XP, if you're not in the room when the corpse is buried, you still get your share of the burial XP (although you only get your own share, not any shared burial xp from groupmates).

There are several things you can do to get rid of corpses besides burying them normally:
*Ritually bury:  When you [[burial commands|ritually bury]] a corpse, you get the same burial XP as usual--but at the same time, you get XP from the command itself.  If you fail to ritually bury a corpse, you get the command XP, but not the burial XP--if this happens, you can still bury the corpse normally to get the burial XP.
*In some rooms, such as on bridges, corpses that are "buried" show up in the room below.  You get burial XP when you "bury" it this way--there's no need to go to the room below and bury it again.
*Order [[creeping doom]] to devour:  Ordering a creeping doom to devour a corpse is incompatible with getting burial XP from that corpse.  You get no XP when it devours it, and it won't devour a corpse that's been buried.
*Turn corpse into spectre:  If you perform [[Unquiet Spirit]] to turn a corpse into a spectre, you won't get burial XP.  You can, however, perform the ritual on corpses that have been buried and recovered.
*Destroy with [[Withering Touch]]:  If you perform Withering Touch on a corpse to destroy it, you will get burial XP.  You can only perform the ritual on corpses that haven't been buried yet.

It makes no difference whatsoever who deals the deathblow or who performs the actual burial.  Even if someone who wasn't in combat with the npc buries the corpse, you'll get the same amount of burial XP.

====Division and sharing of kill and burial xp====
When an npc is fighting multiple people&lt;ref>Note that "people the npc is in combat with" can include: other players (whether grouped or not), pets, fruitbats, hired mercenaries, totems, and dust devils.  (Skeleton warriors from the "[[Grisald's Reanimated Guardian]]" wizard spell are a special case, and don't seem to count at all: you can use one without any reduction in xp for yourself or your groupmates.)  The [[calm]] ritual will cause the npc to stop fighting anyone who's not in the room, as well as the performer.  [[Chant]] has a wider effect--it can also cause everyone in the room to stop fighting, though it is [[pk-checked]].  However, just "stop"ping fighting will not make the npc stop fighting ''you''.&lt;/ref>--who are either in the same room or at most one room away&lt;ref>Changed on December 6, 2015, and announced {{Devblog|623|here}}.&lt;/ref>--the kill and bury XP awarded by that npc will be affected.  First, the kill and bury XP are divided by the number of people the npc is in combat with (again, only counting people in the same room as the npc or immediately adjacent rooms).  Then, a small amount--perhaps 10 or 12 XP for two people--seems to be added.

After any division that takes place, kill and bury XP are shared with [[group]]mates as follows:
*Up to half of each person's kill and burial XP is shared with any groupmates who are in the same room and less than five minutes idle.  This sharing takes the form of giving free XP to your groupmates--your own XP isn't diminished by it.
*If a groupmate's guild level is less than half of your own, you only share a fraction of your kill and burial xp equal to (their guild level/your guild level), instead of half.
*You do share kill and burial XP with non-combatant groupmates.  However, combatants will get more kill and burial XP overall, since they get their own share of the kill and burial XP ''in addition to'' shared XP from groupmates.

Note that [[pets]] and [[fruitbat]]s being in combat do cause the xp to be divided, but they don't share any, even with their owners or summoners.  This includes moon dragons--despite the fact that as soon as they're attacked, they fly up to perch on your shoulder and so aren't involved in the combat beyond draining xp.

The end result for the ''simplest'' case--where all combatants have the same guild level and are grouped with each other--is that each person gets half of solo XP, plus solo XP divided by twice the number of combatants, plus a bit (from the small amount that is added after the division, and then shared).

{|class="wikitable" | border="1"
 ! '''Grouped combatants'''
 ! '''Approximate kill and burial XP for each combatant'''
 |-
 | 1
 | 100%
 |-
 | 2
 | 75%
 |-
 | 3
 | 67%
 |-
 | 4
 | 63%
 |-
 | 5
 | 60%
 |-
 | 6
 | 58%
 |-
 |}

Since non-combatant groupmates in the same room will get half of their combatant groupmates' kill and burial XP shared with them, this adds up to 50%&lt;ref>More precisely, 50% of the ''average'' of what each combatant groupmate would get from killing and burying that npc solo.&lt;/ref> regardless of the number of combatants.

It's worth emphasizing that this ''only'' holds true for that simplest case.  More typically, group members will ''not'' all have exactly the same guild level, even if they are similar, so they will get different amounts of kill xp to begin with (and, of course, share different amounts of kill xp with their groupmates).

Interestingly, groupmates with lower guild levels can raise the overall amount of XP you get from an npc, because their lower guild level causes them to receive more kill XP, which is then partially passed on.

[[Totem]]s and [[dust devil]]s are a little more complex in the way they share XP.  They will share up to half their kill and bury XP with their summoner, but only a quarter of it with the summoner's groupmates.  So, for the summoner, they act as an extra groupmate, but for the summoner's groupmates they'll "drain" more XP.  If one of these minions disappears (i.e. is dismissed or dies) before the npc dies, it won't be included in the division: it will be as though the minion was never in the fight.  However, it if disappears after the death but before the burial, it will be included in the ''division'' of burial XP, but won't ''share'' any of the burial xp.  It's therefore a good idea to bury before your minions disappear.

===Command XP===
Nearly all guild [[commands]] give XP when executed.  For the most part, the amount of xp they give is twenty times the amount of gp spent.  However, if the gp spent is 5 or less (such as with [[value]], or fueling a [[broomstick]] with 5 gp or less), no xp is given.

This XP award is reduced based on how often the command in question has been executed and how many other commands have been executed in the meantime.  Every time the player executes a [[:Category:Commands|command]] (or casts a particular [[:Category:Spells|spell]]/[[:Category:Rituals|ritual]]), the MUD increments a count for that command.  The counter is halved if the command hasn't been executed in the last 5 minutes.  The XP award is divided by (1 + count) if the count is less than 10, and is set to zero if the count is 10 or more.

As of November 1, 2012[https://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/blog/blog.c?action=filter&amp;blog=recent%20developments&amp;id=455], command xp is no longer shared with groupmates.

===Heartbeat XP===
The simplest of all XP to gain, heartbeat XP is a uniform 3 XP per '[[heartbeat]]'--until your xp rate reaches 500,000 XP/hour, at which point it drops to 2 XP per heartbeat (and further drops when your xp rate reaches higher amounts).  The heartbeat rate is approximately one per two seconds, though this varies in periods of [[lag]].

===Exploration XP===
Exploration XP is a small amount of XP{{research}} awarded to a player whenever they enter a room that nobody else has entered for a while.  You can get exploration XP from entering a room which already ''contains'' an npc or another player (although the other player presumably must have been sitting there for a while), and you can get it from entering a room you just looked into.  For the most part, you get exploration xp from non-terrain rooms--rooms in cities, villages, etc.  While you usually get no xp from terrain rooms, you can sometimes get small amounts on the roads in the terrains.

Exploration xp seems to range from around 0 to 470 xp per room, with the higher amounts being rarer.  It's unclear what determines the amount you can get; it may be random.

Rooms don't seem to give exploration XP shortly after a reboot.

There are achievements in the Exploration category for getting various amounts of exploration XP:
*{{Achievement|Novice Explorer}}
*{{Achievement|The Happy Wanderer}}
*{{Achievement|Across The Universe}}

===Mission and job XP===
[[Jobs]], or missions, give varying amounts of XP and money, depending on the specific job.  You can do them as many times as you like.

Some jobs have a waiting period before you can get another one.  With others, you can get another one of the same type right away (if it's available), but you'll get less XP and money from it.

With [[Sam Slager|sausage-making missions]] in particular, if the mission is done while grouped, the xp is split evenly among groupmates.

[[Agatean_family#Missions|Agatean family missions]] work differently.  You cannot apply for a specific mission, but are assigned one randomly when you ask for a mission.  You must be a member of the family to do missions for them, and you must wait half an hour between finishing (or failing) a mission before you can get another one.

===Quest XP===
[[Quests]] give an amount of XP related to the QP value of the quest{{research}}.

{|class="wikitable" border="1"

 |15000

===Achievement XP===
[[Achievements]] give an amount of XP related to the level of the achievement, as follows:

{|class="wikitable" border="1"

 |5107500
 |}

===Teaching XP===
[[Teaching]] another player skills results in the teacher being awarded the XP spent by the student raised to the power of 0.8 for each level that the teacher was able to teach without difficulty, reduced by 50% for a level where the teacher failed the teaching skillcheck.

===Newspaper XP===
Writing articles for [[newspaper]]s gives XP as follows:
*The authors of the each article get 60000 XP.
*The newspaper's editors get 10% of the total article XP, plus 120000 XP; the editor XP is divided up between all the editors.

===Resurrection XP===
Successfully [[Resurrect|resurrecting]] someone gives the priest a portion of the xp that the former ghost got returned.  This seems to be equal to the xp returned to the ghost, raised to the power of .77 or .78.  However, this xp is subject to penalties due to xp rate.

==Spending XP==
Players spend their XP by increasing their skills, by one of the following means:
*Advancing their skills at their guild.
*[[teaching|Learning]] from another player.
*Learning from themself.

Advancing skills at the guild is significantly cheaper than learning from players.  Learning from another player is marginally cheaper than learning from yourself; the cost saving is dependent on the ratio between your level and their [[teaching|effective teaching bonus]].

These graphs show the cost of advancing via various means:

{|border="0"
 |-
 | width="205px" | [[Image:XPlearn0_300.gif|border|200px|link={{filepath:XPlearn0_300.gif}}]]

 |-
 | width="205px" | ''Cost of advancing 1 level''&lt;br>''(levels 0 to 300)''
 | width="205px" | ''Cost of advancing 1 level''&lt;br>''(levels 300 to 600)''
 |-
 |}

==Death and losing XP==
The only way to lose XP without spending it is to [[death|die]].  What happens next depends on how the player is brought to life again:
*If [[Raise Dead|raised]], then they come back to life with none of the XP they had when they died.
*If [[resurrect|resurrected]], then they will come back with a percentage of their former XP dependent on the Pishite's skills.  This can be up to 75% of the xp they had when they died.

Any xp gained ''while dead'' will be kept when either raised or resurrected.  While dead, you can gain exploration and (ironically) heartbeat xp.

==XP rate==
Your XP rate--or at least, the rate that is relevant here--is always your rate over the past hour&lt;ref>Actually, the MUD appears to use the amount of xp you've made in the last fifty-nine and a half minutes or so--NOT a full hour--for your rate.  The exact amount of time seems to vary somewhat, though.  You can see this effect if you check your progress in a numberchasing achievement repeatedly about an hour after you gained some amount of XP, and see when that chunk of XP disappears from your rate.  This does, however, assume that the achievements are tied to your rate as calculated by the MUD for other purposes, and that they don't have some separate system for calculating it.&lt;/ref>--in other words, the amount of XP you've made in the past hour.  Quest and achievement XP are not included in your rate.  Heartbeat XP, exploration XP, kill and burial XP, command XP, resurrection XP, family mission XP, and XP from jobs are included.

Your rate only seems to change while you're logged on, with time spent logged out not counted.

The easiest way to check your xp rate is by checking your progress on any unattained [[achievements]] in the Numberchasing category.  You may also be able to get plugins for your client which will tell you your rate, though some will show your ''average'' rate since you logged in or reset the plugin.

There are several achievements related to your rate:
*{{Achievement|Xp Grinder}}: 100k/hour
*{{Achievement|Ex Peas 4 Me}}: 200k/hour
*{{Achievement|Hey Pesto}}: 400k/hour
*{{Achievement|Experiential Learning}}: 600k/hour
*{{Achievement|Numberchasing Nirvana}}: 800k/hour
*{{Achievement|Good Day}}: 1 million per hour
Allowing a broader definition of "rate", there are also two epic achievements for gaining 5 million XP in a single session, during--respectively--a single Disc day or a single Disc night.
*{{Achievement|Day Tripper}}
*{{Achievement|A Hard Day's Night}}

==XP reduction==
[[experience points reduction|XP reduction]] is applied to all forms of income (though not in the exact same way for all of them): kill, bury, command, teaching, resurrection and even heartbeat XP. Income is reduced based on the total XP earned by a player in the previous hour (XP rate). For types of XP other than kill xp, no reduction is applied until a player's rate exceeds 500,000 XP/hr; as a player's rate increases futher, the reduction is also increased. The formula for determining the percentage of your normal xp that you actually ''get'' for XP rates over 500,000 XP/hr is:-

&lt;pre>XP percentage = 50,000,000 / XP rate&lt;/pre>

So, for example, when your rate is exactly 500,000, your percentage is 100%: you're still getting full xp.  But if your rate is 750,000, your percentage is 66%: you're only getting 2/3 of the xp you normally would get.

Kill XP is reduced earlier, when a player's rate exceeds 100,000 XP/hr.  For it, the formula is:

&lt;pre>XP percentage = 10,000,000 / XP rate&lt;/pre>

So, when your rate is 500,000, you're only getting 20% of your normal kill xp.

==The XP cap==
You can't carry an unlimited amount of XP: the amount you can have at one time is capped at thirty million.  The way this seems to work is that if getting a chunk of XP would put you over the cap, you don't get any of it.  For example, if you have 29,999,800 XP and you do something that would normally give you 250 XP, nothing happens.  Therefore, when you get very close to the cap, you'll begin to stop getting XP for things.  Given this, if your heartbeat XP is, at that time, 3 XP per heartbeat, you might stop at 29,999,98; 29,999,99; or 30,000,000 XP exactly.

Even though you don't get XP yourself at this point, you can still share XP with groupmates.  It appears to work normally, except that you share out of what you ''would'' have gotten, had you been able to, instead of what you actually got (0).

It's generally a good idea to spend your XP far before you reach the cap, as dying at 30 million will cost you, at minimum, 7.5 million XP.

[[Category:Concepts]]

=== Content from Experience_points_reduction ===

XP reduction percentage = 50,000,000 / XP rate

The purpose is to narrow the gap between the XP earning potential of the least and most advanced players. The following graph shows the reduction curve.

[[File:Xpreduction1.jpg]]

The effect of XP reduction can be most easily spotted in heartbeat XP, as seen in the monitor when in combat. Initially heartbeat XP is awarded at the rate of 3 XP every heartbeat. XP Reduction is applied to heartbeat XP and the result rounded down to the nearest integer.  Heartbeat XP therefore drops to 2 at a rate of 500 kXP/hr, 1 at 750 kXP/hr and 0 at 1500 kXP/hr. Note that although the heartbeat XP does decay to 0, this is simply due to integer rounding on such a small income, larger incomes such as bury XP will still yield a return after reduction.

==XP Rate Over Time==

Because XP reduction is based on the XP earned in the previous hour it is possible to earn a significantly greater amount of XP in the first hour after a long period of inactivity (Peak XP Rate). The reduction formula then forces the rate down and after a couple of hours it begins stablise. Of course this assumes that XP income remains roughly static, the following graph shows this effect in practice for various income rates.

[[File:Xpreduction2.jpg]]

Assuming that the base XP rate is static, the XP rate will stabilise when:-

Base XP * 500,000/XP rate = XP rate

which can be rearranged to:-

XP rate = sqrt(Base XP * 500,000)

Or in other words the geometric average of 500,000 and the base XP rate.

==Peak XP Rate==

The Peak XP rate can be used to significantly reduce the difficulty of attaining many of the achievements under the "{{Achievementcat|Numberchasing|Numberchasing}}" category:

*{{Achievement|Experiential Learning}} (600,000 XP in one hour)
*{{Achievement|Numberchasing Nirvana}} (800,000 XP in one hour)
*{{Achievement|Good Day}} (1,000,000 XP in one hour)
*{{Achievement|Day Tripper}} (5,000,000 XP during daylight hours of one day)*
*{{Achievement|Hard Day's Night}} (5,000,000 XP during night hours of one day)*
&lt;sub>*Since the length of a day (and night) varies by the time of year, average xp/hr required will vary between 1219512 and 1612903.

The following graph shows the curve of Peak XP rate vs income.

[[File:Xpreduction3.jpg]]

To take the example of "Good Day", a sustained income of approximately 1.25 million XP/hr would be required to achieve the necessary Peak XP rate of 1 million XP/hr.

=== Content from Families ===

You can belong to a family by having a relationship with someone who is already in the family, or by creating your own family.

==Family control room==

You can register a family at the [[service area#Family control room|family control room]] in the [[service area]]s across the Disc.

Type 'help here' once you are in the room to learn more about how to create or deposit money to your family.

Discworld's usual naming, language and harassment rules apply to family names, and your money may not be returned if the name is deemed inappropriate.

==Cost==
A quarter of a Discworld year = 60 [[Roundworld]] days. See [[Time]] and [[Calendar]].

The costs are the same in the various currency.

'''Ankh-Morpork'''
*They cost {{Dollars|A$300}} to start and cost {{Dollars|A$300}} in upkeep every quarter of a Discworld year, plus {{Dollars|50p}} per member.

'''Bes Pelargic'''
*They cost {{Rhinu|250Rh}} to start and cost {{Rhinu|250Rh}} in upkeep every quarter of a Discworld year, plus {{Rhinu|50s}} per member.

'''Djelibeybi'''
*They cost {{Djtoon|DjToon 600}} to start and cost {{Djtoon|DjToon 600}} in upkeep every quarter of a Discworld year, plus {{Djtoon|DjToon 1}} per member.

;Ephebe
*They cost {{Emoney|12M S25|0de}} to start and cost {{Emoney|12M S25|0de}} in upkeep every quarter of a Discworld year, plus {{Emoney|S1|4de}} per member.

;Escrow
*They cost {{Lmoney|LSov 5|9|5|4}} to start and cost {{Lmoney|LSov 5|9|5|4}} in upkeep every quarter of a Discworld year, plus {{Lmoney|Ls 1|4 1/2}} per member.

&lt;pre>
You read the small sign:
Families have a few rules and regulations associated with them.  They cost LSov 5|9|5|4 to start and cost LSov 5|9|5|4 in upkeep every quarter of a Discworld year, plus Ls 1|4 1/2 per member.

You can create relationships between people, and also create families.  It is possible to list families, or details about any particular family.  On a family of yours, you can set the description, see its bank balance and deposit more money into its account.  If your family balance is less than the required amount when it is time for your family to pay for its fees, the family will be disbanded.

You cannot choose a family name from the books for your families.
&lt;/pre>

==Relationship==

Anyone in a family can invite another person into the family.  The command 'relationship' is used to setup new relationships with someone else (and invite them into your family).

You can swap families, but not leave a family, once you have a family name.

==Top Family Table==
Usually the family control room will also have a top family table, listing the families with most of the below:
{{prebox|
You read the top family table:
The family with:
The most members          : {{Family|Womblesworth}}
The oldest average age    : {{Family|MacKill}}
Most average quest points : {{Family|MacKill}}
Most player killers       : {{Family|al-Mu'aqqibat}}

'''Feint''' is a [[:Category:Fighting commands|fighting command]] which can be used to mislead an opponent during combat, causing them to expend time and effort in defending against an attack that never arrives.  This leaves them at a disadvantage against a future attack.

==Execution==
Feint may be performed either with a weapon or while unarmed.  In order to successfully mislead an opponent, it is necessary to:
*Pass a [[fighting.special.weapon]] (or [[fighting.special.unarmed]]) test in order to prepare the attack.
*Succeed in a skillcheck of the relevant [[fighting.melee|fighting.melee.*]] weapon skill (or [[fighting.unarmed.striking]]) against the opponent's [[fighting.special.tactics]] skill.

Note that feint cannot be used against an opponent who is prone, as a result of the [[trip]] or [[shove]] commands.  Likewise, an opponent who has just been feinted cannot be feinted again (by anyone) for a short period until they recover.

==Effects==
Feint does not do any direct damage, but it does deplete the victim's [[action points]]{{research}}.  This may slow their rate of attack or, in extreme cases, leave them temporarily unable to defend themself.

The '''fighting.defence''' skill tree is used to determine a player's ability to defend themselves against physical attacks - whether they come from [[fighting.melee|melee]] or [[fighting.range|ranged]] distance.  

Increasing skills in this branch both improves the chance to successfully defend against an incoming attack, and reduces the [[action point]] cost of that defence.

=== Content from Finger ===
'''Finger''' is a command that you can use on any player or npc, as well as on a deity, a club, a family, or a domain, to gain some information about them.

Syntax:
&lt;pre>finger 
finger &lt;name|domain|club|family>&lt;/pre>

"Finger" by itself will return a list of everyone online, with real names (if set), locations (ditto), and birthdays (also ditto).

==Players==
Player finger info has the following in it:
*Their login name
*Their guild
*The date and time they first logged on
*Their age
*When they last logged off, ''or''--if they are online--how long they've been online and [[idle|how long it's been since they've entered a command]]
*Whether they have any mail, and if so, how many messages and how many unread messages
*Either their project, if they've set one, or "no project"
*Either their plan, if they've set one, or "no plan"

It may optionally also have the following, if the player has set it:
*A name, marked as "real name"
*A location
*A birthday
*An email address
*A home page

Finger information is publicly visible to anyone--though the email address can (uniquely) be set to be visible only to [[creators]] and [[directors]].  You can set these optional things with the "chfn" command (or get the MUD to stop reminding you to set them by using the same command and just leaving them blank).  They can also be set individually under "[[options]] personal".

The "plan" and "project" can be set to anything within the five-line limit, by creating [[alias]]es .plan and .project, respectively (semicolons, ";", will be interpreted as new lines).  For example, "alias .plan 1;2;3;4;5" will cause you to have the following in your finger info:
&lt;pre>Plan:
1
2
3
4
5
&lt;/pre>

==NPCs==
For npcs, the information you get is simply that they ''are'' an npc, as finger info for all npcs looks the same, with the exception of the name:
&lt;pre>>finger sokkard
Login name : sokkard               Real name : Banished               
Not really many seconds old.
No mail ever.
No plan.
No future.&lt;/pre>

==Clubs==
[[Club]]s have the following in their finger info:
*The founder, and where it was founded
*A description (which can be set by the founder)
*A list of online members
*A list of offline members
*A list of recruiters, both online and offline
*If it's an elected club, then the secretary, vice-president, president, treasurer, and when the next election is scheduled.

==Families==
[[Family|Families]] have the following in their finger info:
*The founder, and where it was founded
*A description
*A list of members

==Deities==
[[:Category:Worshippable gods|Worshippable deities]] have the following in their finger info:
*Name and title
*A description
*The current high entity
*The approximate [[alignment]] requirements
*The number of followers
*The number of priests

Non-worshippable [[:Category:Gods|deities]], on the other hand, only have the following in their finger info:
*Name and title
*A description
*"&lt;Pronoun> currently can't be worshipped."

==Domains==
[[Domains]] have the following in their finger info:
*The leader of the domain
*The deputy of the domain
*[[Creators]] in the domain
*A description

==See also==
*[[Alias]]
*[[Reference]]
*[[Who]]

=== Content from Fix ===

}}

'''Fix''' is a [[:Category:Crafts commands|crafts command]] which allows you to attempt to improve the [[condition]] of a metallic item in your inventory (usually [[weapons]], [[armour]] and [[jewellery]]) when in a [[smithy]].

==Using==
Once they have learned the command, players can fix an item if:
*They are in a [[smithy]].
*The item is [[condition|damaged]], even if just a little bit which is not enough to refer to the item as damaged.
*They have at least 35 crafts [[guild points]].
*They are not wearing the item.

To tell if an item could be fixed if it's just a little bit damaged and can't even be referred to as &lt;code>damaged&lt;/code>, you can do &lt;code>fix cost &lt;item>&lt;/code> in a [[smithy]] or [[launder room]].

The [[crafts.smithing]] skill subtree determines a player's ability to fix items, as follows:
*Higher bonuses cause more condition to be fixed with each execution of the command.
*Higher bonuses are needed in order to fix items that start off in a worse [[condition]].

Attempting to fix seriously damaged items with low skills may result in the item being destroyed.

It is also possible to try to hone a weapon with an [[oilstone]].

==Cost==
Fixing costs a small amount of money, depending on the degree to which the item is damaged, and the player's bonus in the appropriate [[crafts.smithing]] subtree.
