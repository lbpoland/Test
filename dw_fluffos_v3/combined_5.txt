=== Content from Death ===

==Raise &amp; Resurrect==
As long as you still have some [[lives]] in reserve, you can be raised or resurrected as below.
*Note that you must wait for DEATH to finish his speech before you can be raised or resurrected.

Otherwise nothing short of the [[Rite of AshkEnte]] will allow you to be corporeal again.

===Raise Dead ritual===

[[Raise Dead]] is a ritual granted by [[Gufnork]], [[Pishe]] and [[Sek]]. It is also available through some [[NPC]]s and in some special rooms, usually requiring some interaction by the ghost, such as using the command "raise" or saying "please raise me". I don't know if any of the NPCs are language sensitive. It will restore the ghostly player to a more substantial form, albeit with a reduced [[constitution]] stat, no [[Experience|XP]] other than that gained while dead, and very low [[HP]]. This is the same as being raised in the shrines and temples listed below.

The [[Restore]] ritual can fix their constitution stat afterwards.

===Resurrect ritual===

[[Resurrect]] is a ritual granted by [[Pishe]]. The advantages of resurrect is that it can restore some of the lost XP and will also restore player stats, but it will not restore [[HP]].

Resurrect needs a lot of energy ([[GP]]) to cast, and even high level Priests and Priestesses can fail. They will then have to wait for their [[GP]] to build up before trying again. Most Priests and Priestesses do not appreciate funny stunts while waiting, and the best advice if this occurs is to "keep your hands away from the keyboard and wait patiently". Your funny stunt may be perceived as complaining about ritual failure (see above) which may lead to you receiving a reduced service. This might be, but is not limited to: raise dead instead of resurrect, no healing after raising / resurrection, no restore after a raise, or the pishite just leaving.

The percentage of [[Experience|XP]] return seems to be based on the [[faith.rituals.curing.target]] bonus of the priest doing the resurrection, and any [[ritual modifiers]]. The return to the resurrected person seems to be capped at 75% of their pre-death XP.  Note, however, that this only applies to the xp they had when they died.  Any xp accumulated while dead is returned in full.

A pishite will not necessarily be able to tell you what your XP return will be. However, unless you had little xp on you when you died, it makes sense to look for the highest resurrection bonus you can. The [http://skills.gothmudders.com/skill.php?skill=faith.rituals.curing.target skills website] and the "who pishe" or "who RRU" command may help. Note, however, that ghosts asking Pishites for their bonuses at their moment of need may alienate those Pishites.

See also the ritual information for [[Resurrect]].

==Getting Resurrected==

There are people who will try and help you.
*These are generally [[Pishe|Pishites]], who are granted the ritual [[resurrect]].
*There are a small but slowly increasing number of non Pishites and even non Priests who can also resurrect using [[faith rods]].
*See [[resurrect alts]] for a list of characters who have an alt that can resurrect.

You should:

*Be Polite, we did not kill you, we are trying to help you.
*Understand that immediately and now are relative, and may depend on your rescuers ability to first lead any groupmates to a safe area and then travel half way across the disc.
*Warn rescuers of any specific hazards, like Yetis or Spiders in the room with your corpse. If it killed you, it may present a hazard to us too, we're not all big tough fighters like you were before you died.
*Show appreciation. This need not be financial, but your attitude may affect the response next time you need assistance.
*Remember that in [[terrains]], the easiest way for us to find you is by using "[[Find Corpse]]", so staying with your corpse helps.  Staying in the room with your corpse may also be the only thing that stops the room from unloading (and taking your former inventory with it) if your corpse decays (particularly if there are no living things in the room with it).&lt;ref>If you ran off and aren't sure exactly where your corpse is now, you have a couple of options.  First, you can use "history" or your scrollback to help retrace your steps.  Second, you can check the [[map (command)|ascii map]]--this shows where living things are, so sometimes it can give you a rough idea of the path you took (and if you were killed by a living thing, it's likely still in the room).  If you died underwater, remember that corpses sink to the bottom.&lt;/ref>
*Be specific about where you are, if you can.  If you're in a city, the name of the street you're on is helpful (although some streets, like Endless Street or Long Street, are large enough that more information may be necessary).  If you're in a building, tell us.  If you're in a hidden area&lt;ref>Somewhere you get to through a non-obvious exit, or somewhere where you have to do something to make the exit visible.&lt;/ref>, be clear about that--not everyone knows about all of those.
*'''Stay Still''' while being resurrected, if you walk away during the ritual, the priest will waste 3 minutes of gp regeneration on a failed ritual! ''Unfollow your groupmates'' if they might move.

You should not, under any circumstances, complain about:

*Response time.
*Delays waiting for GP regeneration.
*Failure to Raise / Resurrect / Restore.
*Inability to retrieve heavy items from your drowned corpse.
*The unwillingness of rescuers to die whilst retrieving your equipment.
*Less XP return than you expected.

If the ritual failed, sit tight and wait quietly unless the priest says otherwise.
*A priest that has just failed a ressurect or raise ritual probably feels upset enough about it without you doing or saying anything at all.
*GP regen is normally required before the ritual can be repeated.
*We didn't kill you, we're trying to help. Please don't get annoyed at us!

After resurrection, preferably after getting [[Hit_points#Ways_to_recover_hit_points|healed]], the following commands will be helpful:

:&lt;code>get all from &lt;name> corpse&lt;/code> where &lt;name> is your simple character name, and
:&lt;code>equip&lt;/code> which should be done quickly so that you don't fumble items.

Please note that if you have, for example, magic scrolls on your corpse, it can be hazardous and even fatal to get your inventory before you have been healed.
*Players have died their final death doing this.
*Even a single scroll skillcheck can be failed by an experienced wizard! Wait until you have been healed.
*The same applies to, eg, getting and equipping poniards.

It would also be a good idea to warn the pishite in advance if there are npcs likely to attack you after you are resurrected, eg Hitmen or City Guards in Genua, Royal Guards in Sto Lat, etc.
*They may be able to take action to minimise the risk to you of dying immediately to such an attack, such as resurrecting you in a passage room.

==Points to Remember==

Remember that after both Resurrect and Raise you will need some healing before you do anything that may cause a loss of HP. After Raise you will also need a Restore or to wait for your Con stat to increase to its normal level.
Shrines, Temples etc.

==RRU==

"What about my expensive equipment?" you ask.

There is a club called RRU who generally try and help people who have died in difficult to reach or hazardous locations, however the help they can give is obviously limited to suitably skilled people being logged on at the right time. If the only RRU member logged in is a weak Pishite with a moderate healing bonus, don't expect them to pull your corpse out of the snail, climb to the hub and resurrect you, or swim to the bottom of the circle sea.

Finally, if it's that valuable, you're in an impossible to reach or extremely dangerous area, and you had a spare life, then consider the use of godmother (see below).

RRU have their own [http://rru.50megs.com/ website] but it is out of date.

==NPC Raise Dead Locations==

These are locations where a ghostly player may be restored to a more substantial form without player assistance. In all cases, the restored player will have reduced stats. You may need to use a command (such as "raise") or request the help of NPC ("say please raise me" or "sayto &lt;npc> please raise me"), and some of the NPCs may be language sensitive. The known locations are:

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-

|}

==Godmother==

The NPC of last resort, the [[Godmother]] will transfer you to your start location, raise you and (as long as you request her help in the same room as your corpse is in) bring your body along as well, but she will charge, initially just a temporary stat drop, later on she charges a life. Make sure you have a spare life before using the godmother command. If you are having problems understanding or communicating with the good fairy, just "say yes", "nod" your head and "think yes".

If aggressive NPCs are attacking the godmother, or she's drowning when you summon her, just use "think yes" after she appears, and usually that will do the trick.

Note that if an aggressive NPC attacks and kills the godmother when you summon her, the NPC should be [[bug report|bugrepped]] for attacking the godmother.

==Other Useful Information==

===Your Corpse and Inventory===
Upon death, everything on you will be on your corpse, except pets, which will remain in your arms. Your corpse will decompose over the course of an hour, and will continue to do so even after you've logged off.  When it finishes, any items that were on it (your former inventory) will be left on the floor.  Items on the floor can be lost if someone picks them up, or if the room unloads, so it's a good idea to get your stuff as soon as possible and not log off while dead.

Getting your inventory off your corpse can be almost as problematic for the newbie as sorting out their first resurrection. Here is a useful alias, it assumes a player's name is bob.

&lt;p style="background-color:black;color:white;font-family:monospace;padding:1em 2em">alias aliveagain get all from bob corpses;equip;get all from bob corpses;equip;get all from bob corpses;equip;get flowers;braid them in my hair&lt;/p>

This alias will recover your inventory from your corpse when you are in the same room as it, and equip all worn or held items that it can from that inventory, which should prevent fumbling due to an excessive inventory count.

There's 3 get all because you can have up to 50 things in your inventory, plus money which counts as one when picking up.

Simply return to the room with your corpse and use the command "aliveagain".

Remember to wait until you've been fully healed to do this--see the previous note about scrolls and other potentially damaging items.

===New Lives===

You have a number of deaths remaining until your '''final death'''. However, you can [[Buying Lives|buy more lives]], so dying can be merely expensive rather than, um, fatal.

===Your Opponents===

If you died in combat, your opponents will stop fighting you. That is, once you're raised or resurrected and are in the same room as they are, they won't attack you. This doesn't apply to NPCs who are aggressive in the first place, such as crocodiles.

==Final Death==
When you have died and have no more lives left, your death will be notified to players around the MUD.

What it looks like when you have died for the last time:
{{prebox|
You have died your final death. Your name will be inscribed in the Hall of Legends.
Aristotle has died for the last time. He is mourned.
An Igor walks up to the corpse of Aristotle and quickly strips all the items from it before walking off with them.
}}

If a Pishe priest or any other priest tries to resurrect you, they will see this message:
{{prebox|
Death tells you: NO, THIS TIME HE IS COMPLETELY DEAD.
}}

The only way to return to corporeality is if other players complete the [[Rite of AshkEnte]].
*This is very expensive and time consuming.
*You lose all money and most items.
*Your skills are cut.

=== Content from Decay ===

The following items tend to decay:
*[[Corpse]]s and [[corpse#corpse bits|their parts]] rot.
*[[Flowers]] wither.  They can not be pickled or dried.
*[[Food and drink|Food]] rots.
*[[Food and drink|Ice and ice-cream]] melt.

A helpful syntax for referring to the oldest of a kind of item that's been in your inventory is &lt;code>&lt;item> -1&lt;/code>.  This would most likely be of use for consuming decayable [[:Category:Spell components|spell]] or [[:Category:Ritual components|ritual components]].

== Preservation ==
The effect can sometimes be stopped with [[pickling]], drying via [[Mama Blackwing's Potent Preserver]] or the [[Preserve]] command.

There are also [[containers]] that can prevent rot on food items (but not melt):
* {{itemdb|3111|Hello Monkey! lunchbox}}
* {{itemdb|6487|dusty box}}
* Wizard's lunch sack from [[Wurphle's Packed Lunch]]

=== Content from Defend ===
'''Defend''' is a command you can use to defend another person. You will attempt to [[parry]] on their behalf, and so defend them.

If you use this command without any arguments it shows who is defending you and who you are defending in the room.

Conversely, to stop defending, you can '''undefend'''.

===Syntax===

&lt;pre>
> defend &lt;living>
You defend &lt;living>.

> defend
No one is defending you.
Of the people in this room, you are defending &lt;living>.

> undefend &lt;living>
You stop defending &lt;living>.
&lt;/pre>

===Mechanics===

*Defending someone makes you attempt to [[parry]] on their behalf. This is less extreme than [[protect]], which makes you move bodily in the way of the attack to take the hit.

*You need to have your combat response set to parry or block to defend. It does not work with dodging because jumping out of the way would not hamper the incoming attacks in the least.

*When Defending someone, keep in mind that your [[Action Points|AP]] will take a massive hit every time you attempt to block or parry on their behalf. As such, you may make fewer/no attacks per round in the event that they are attacked multiple times. You also may not take defensive actions on your own behalf in this case.

*Defending against any attacks will pull you into combat with any enemies that are attempting to harm your ward.

*If you are parrying to defend your ward you can use [[riposte]] to attempt to maintain an offensive stand under the AP constraints of defending your ward.

=== Content from Description_line_(item) ===
An item's description is made up of several lines.

==Main description==
This is a description of what the item looks like.  While it's usually fairly static, there are some items on which this part changes.

==Name (if deluded)==
If an item is [[delude]]d, there will be a line saying what it is, of the form:
&lt;pre>&lt;Deluded Name> is a &lt;normal short name of item>.&lt;/pre>

==Holyness==
Certain holy items--[[holy symbol]]s, [[holy amulet]]s, [[holy relic]]s, [[prayer book]]s, and [[prayer beads]]--have a line indicating which deity they're [[consecrate]]d to.

*[[Pishe]]: The &lt;item> radiates a reassuring cyan glow like the sun after rain.
*[[Gufnork]]: The &lt;item> gently radiates a fuzzy white glow.
*[[Gapp]]: The &lt;item> stylishly radiates a pristine golden light.
*[[Sandelfon]]: The &lt;item> indifferently radiates a harsh grey light.
*[[Fish]]: The &lt;item> slowly pulsates, washing from a deep blue to a light aquamarine.
*[[Hat]]: The &lt;item> sheds an irritating orange glow that makes you feel that someone is creeping up on you.
*[[Sek]]: The &lt;item> beats regularly with blood-red pulses of light.

==Consumed==
Some items can be consumed or used up in some way, and have a line indicating how much of them has been used. (Note that food that has been partially eaten has lines ''after'' other effects showing this.)

===Books of cigarette papers===
A book of cigarette papers has a line showing how many papers are left in it:
&lt;pre>There are &lt;number> papers left in it.&lt;/pre>

===Burnable items===
A [[candle]] or block of [[incense]] has this line, which also shows whether it's lit.
&lt;pre>It is &lt;lit|not currently lit>.  It is &lt;stage>.&lt;/pre>

These are the stages of regular non-scented candles:
* It is new.
* It is almost new.
* It is not yet halfway burnt.
* It is more than halfway burnt.
* It is almost burnt to a stub.
* It is burnt to a stub.

Various scented candles have slightly different stages:
* It is brand new.
* It is almost new.
* It is not yet halfway burnt.
* It is more than halfway burnt.
* It is almost burnt to the bottom.
* It is burnt down to a small lumpy disk of wax.

A coarse waxen candle has a slightly different set of stages:
*It looks brand new.
*It looks almost new.
*It is not yet halfway burnt.
*It is more than halfway burnt.
*It is almost burnt to a stub.
*It is burnt to a stub.

Blocks of incense have this set of stages:
* It is unmarred and unburned.
* It is slightly scorched.
* Half of it has burnt away.
* It is nearly completely burnt.
* It is burnt to a stub.

[[Lantern]]s have two lines.  One shows whether it's lit, and the other shows the fuel left.

The first line is one of:
*The lantern is not lit.
*The wick flickers inside spreading a dull glow.

The stages of fuel left are:
*?
*It is almost completely out of fuel.
*?

[[Torch]]es do not have an extra line showing how much of them is left or whether they're lit--rather, their entire description changes.

==Special corpse statuses==
A [[corpse]] can have pieces of it cut off with a knife.  If this has been done to it, there's a line that looks like this:
&lt;pre>It appears to be missing its &lt;body part(s)>.&lt;/pre>

A corpse that is going to turn into a [[vampire]] has this line added to it:
&lt;pre>It seems to be twitching slightly, almost as if it's still alive.  You probably shouldn't get too close.&lt;/pre>

==Other effects==
There are various other effects that can be applied to an item.  They show up in the order they were applied in--for example, if you perform [[Light]] on something, then ward it, the Light line will be before the ward line until the Light ritual runs out.  If you perform Light on it again after the first one runs out, the line will then be ''after'' the ward line.

==Corpse inventory==
A corpse will have the same [[Description_line#Inventory|inventory and purse]] lines as the living thing it used to be.

==Eaten==
[[Food]] (including [[fluff]]) that has been partially eaten has a line showing how much is left:
&lt;pre>It is about &lt;amount> gone.&lt;/pre>

==Decayed==
Most [[food]] has a line showing how fresh or decayed it is.  The stages are:
*It looks nice and fresh.
*It looks a bit rotten.
*It is half rotten.
*It is mostly rotten.
*It is almost completely rotten.

If you [[pickle]] it, the line becomes:
&lt;pre>It seems to have been pickled.&lt;/pre>

Decay is explained in more detail here: [[Decay]]

==Octarine==
These lines, in octarine, are visible only to [[wizards]] and [[witches]] naturally.  Others can see them by using [[Detect Magic]] on the item or zapping a [[short wand]] at it.

===Enchantment===
First, if the item is [[enchantment|enchanted]], there will be a line showing the level.  The normal levels are:
* 1-10%: 'It occasionally pulses with octarine light'
* 11-20%: 'It emits a slight octarine glow'
* 21-30%: 'It softly pulses in dull octarine shades'
* 31-40%: 'It gives off a steady but dull octarine glow'
* 41-50%: 'It gives off a steady octarine glow'
* 51-60%: 'It glows an intense octarine'
* 61-70%: 'It emits a bright octarine colour'
* 71-80%: 'It brightly pulses octarine'
* 81-90%: 'It glows brilliant octarine shades'
* 91-100%: 'It radiates pure octarine brilliance' 

===Delusion or talismanhood===
Next, if it is a [[talisman]] or [[Delusions of Grandeur|proto-talisman]], there will be a line showing its level.  The levels are:
* It has a faint octarine shadow about it that disappears if you look at it squarely.
* It has a faint octarine shadow about it.
* It has an octarine shadow about it that flickers occasionally out of the corner of your eye.
* It has a flickering octarine shadow about it.
* It has a flickering octarine haze about it. 
* It has the hazy octarine sparkle of a magical talisman. 

The last one indicates a full talisman.

==Pockets==
Some [[clothing]] has pockets.  It has a line indicating this:
&lt;pre>The &lt;item> has &lt;pocket or pockets>.&lt;/pre>

If there's anything in it, and it's not closed, there's an additional line showing what's in it.
&lt;pre>It is &lt;fullness> with: &lt;item or items>.&lt;/pre>

There's also a line saying whether it's open or closed.  Either:
&lt;pre>It is open.&lt;/pre>
Or:
&lt;pre>You cannot see inside it.  It is closed.&lt;/pre>

==Writing==
If the item has something written on it, you'll see this line:
&lt;pre>It appears to have something written on it.&lt;/pre>

==Condition==
Most items have a line showing their [[condition]]:
&lt;pre>It is in &lt;condition> condition.&lt;/pre>

Not all items have this line, but not having the line doesn't necessarily mean it has no condition and can't be broken (for example, [[music|musical instruments]] can break if held when fighting or, sometimes, in containers).

==Contents==
Some [[container]]s (possibly non-clothing containers) have a line or two ''after'' the condition describing the contents. For dry containers, it looks like this:
&lt;pre>The &lt;item> is &lt;fullness> with &lt;item(s)>.&lt;/pre>

For vessels, it looks like this:
&lt;pre>The cup is about one-quarter full with two ounces of green tea.
It is about one-quarter full.&lt;/pre>

In either case, the line or lines are only there if the container is open and not empty.

==Open/closed==
Some containers have the line saying whether it's open or closed here.  It looks like either:
&lt;pre>It is open.&lt;/pre>
Or:
&lt;pre>It is closed.&lt;/pre>

Books also have this line, but the "open" version looks like:
&lt;pre>It is open at page &lt;number>.&lt;/pre>

[[Category:Customization]]

=== Content from Description_line ===

== Name ==
When you look at a player, the first line you'll see is their full name, with any pre-[[title]]s or post-titles they may have.

If you have eaten a [https://dw.daftjunk.com/items/index.php?item=3293 hard-n-long sensation] this line is replaced by:
:{{prebox|You see a cute fluffy sheep of the Woolly Thinker's Guild.}}

This line is missing for [[npc]]s.

== Species ==
By default, this line is either, "She is a strapping young human lass", "He is a strapping young human lad", or "It is a strapping young human".  It can be changed by using a [[compact]].

If you have eaten a [https://dw.daftjunk.com/items/index.php?item=3293 hard-n-long sensation] this line is replaced by:
 {{prebox|It is a fluffy and adorable sheep who really looks unhappy about something.
There is something about the squint that reminds you of &lt;player>.}}

This line is missing for [[npc]]s.

== Description ==
Next, there's the description, set with the [[Writing a description|describe]] command.

== Health ==
The next line shows their [[hit points|health]].

== Position ==
The next line shows their [[position]].  This can be changed with the "position" command.  You can also change it by sitting, standing, lying, kneeling, meditating, or crouching.

If you have eaten a [https://dw.daftjunk.com/items/index.php?item=3293 hard-n-long sensation] this line is missing.

If you're in a magical land due to having gazed into a [[Thousand_Dancing_Celestial_Fates#The_zodiac_charm|zodiac charm]], your position is set to, "wandering around within a shimmering bauble".

== Witch warts ==
A [[witch]] will have the line, "You can't help but notice &lt;number> warts upon her face."

The number is a rough indication of guild level, at one wart per ten levels.

== Pet fur ==
Certain [[pet]]s have a line describing the state of their fur.

{|class="wikitable sortable"
!Appearance || Pet || state
|-
|His fur is brushed into a perfect display of ordered curls. || large poodle || brushed
|-
|His fur is rough and woolly. || large poodle || unbrushed
|-
|A burr is snarled up in his woolly fur. || large poodle || burred (1)
|-
|There are &lt;number from two to ten> burrs snarled up in his woolly fur, which is beginning to look a little matted. || large poodle || burred (2 - 10)
|-
|His fur is silky and smooth. || wolfhound || brushed
|-
|His fur is happily disordered. || wolfhound || unbrushed
|-
|A burr is snarled up in his fur. || wolfhound || burred (1)
|-
|There are &lt;number from two to eight> burrs snarled up in his fur. || wolfhound || burred (2 - 8)
|-
|There are many burrs snarled up in his fur. || wolfhound || burred (9 - 10)
|-
|}


== Tattoos ==
Next, any [[tattoo parlour|tattooed]] body part that is visible will have a line showing the tattoo.

== Temperature ==
If you're particularly hot or cold, there will be a line showing your [[temperature]].

== Inventory ==
Anything visible that is held, worn, or carried will be shown here.
:First are any items that are held.
:Then the top layer of things that are worn. Anything below other items will not be shown.
:Then everything that is carried except money.

If you have eaten a [https://dw.daftjunk.com/items/index.php?item=3293 hard-n-long sensation] these lines are missing.

== Purse ==
Finally, you can see approximately how full the person's purse is.  This seems to indicate number of [[coins]], rather than type, however.  The message that their purse "is home to only moths!" indicates a small number of coins, rather than a completely empty purse; if they have no [[money]] at all, then this line will be missing.

If you have eaten a [https://dw.daftjunk.com/items/index.php?item=3293 hard-n-long sensation] this line is missing.

=== Content from Dexterity ===

==Direct effects==
*Dexterity directly affects a player's ability to hit things with weapons.
*Dexterity directly affects the [[trip]] command.

==Defense/Burden effects==
With a higher dexterity value you can have a higher burden before getting disadvantage combat messages.

*With your dexterity &lt;15 the message "You are slightly disadvantaged in your defensive effectiveness by your current burden" is starting with 15% burden.
*With your dexterity >=15 you can have 19% burden before getting these messages.

==Skill relationships==

*Dexterity features prominently in the [[Skills - Covert|covert]] skill tree, heavily affecting all skills there.
*It plays a significant role in the [[Skills - Crafts|crafts]], [[Skills - Magic|magic]], [[Skills - Fighting|fighting]] and [[Skills - Adventuring|adventuring]] skill trees.
*It is not used very much in the [[Skills - People|people]] or [[Skills - Faith|faith]] skill trees.

==Guild reliance==

*[[Thieves]] and [[assassins]] require very high levels of dexterity to perform their covert commands well.
*[[Witches]] and [[wizards]] often have fairly high levels of dexterity due to its relevance in the important [[magic.methods.physical]] skill subtree.
*[[Warriors]] also often have high levels of dexterity as many weapon and defensive skills require it.
*[[Priests]] are the only guild without a strong reliance on dexterity.

'''Doctor Kelleflump's Deadly Demon''' (abbreviated as '''DKDD''') is a offensive [[:Category:Wizard spells|spell]] that summons a powerful demon to attack the target.

==Casting==
This spell costs 55 [[GP]] to cast and takes up 60 units of [[mind space]].

===Skills===

The following skills are used in the stages of this spell:
* [[Magic.methods.physical.dancing]]
* [[Magic.methods.mental.cursing]]
* [[Magic.methods.spiritual.summoning]]
* [[Magic.methods.spiritual.abjuring]]
* [[Magic.methods.spiritual.banishing]]

===Components===
*[[human heart]] (consumed)

===Useful items===
*[[twisted black amulet]] (optional, degrades)
Black amulets only protect against damage from the demon AFTER a successful cast and are not a required component any more ({{Devblog|390 blog}}).

The damage they can still absorb is proportional to their [[octarine level]]. You can wear two amulets to have the second one absorb damage when the first one fails.

Damage from a spell failure is NOT buffered by the black amulet, so beware if you are weak in the methods!
