== Write for your audience ==

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long%3B_didn%27t_read too long didn't read] principle might seem counter-intuitive to apply in a MUD environment, which is constructed from text after all.  But enjoyment of a MUD does not necessarily require that all output that is sent to players be read, and once familiar with MUD mechanics, players will make their own choices about which output needs to be read and how closely.

Many people play with &lt;code>brief look&lt;/code> turned on and many who use &lt;code>verbose look&lt;/code> recognise rooms by the shape of the text or an ascii map output, not by what the long description actually says.  When a player is standing in the same room as you, they might look at you, but if your description is too long there is a fair chance they will skim through it, or skip over it.  

If your description is worth writing then presumably you want people to read it, and they simply won't do that if it's too much effort.  However, anything over three lines could well represent too large a block of text for a player to want to spend the time to read.  As a rule of thumb, under 240 characters is recommended for player descriptions, or the equivalent of three lines of text when using an 80 column window (a setting used by many people).

==Who's looking?==

Keep in mind when writing your description that you don't know who's reading it. It makes sense to have "You feel quite intimidated by him." in your description if your audience is weaker than you, but what about when you go to learn from Lanfear? Is she really going to be frightened of some level 200 [[assassin]]? The same goes for things like "She is the most beautiful woman you've ever seen." How do you know? And what about when two people have that in their descriptions? Do they keep getting more attractive as you look back and forward between them?

Describe your character objectively and without reference to the viewer. You're not in control of their character and it's rude (and often wildly inaccurate) to presume you know what their reaction will be.

==Are you a robot?==

Do you smile every time anyone looks at you? Of course you don't. Sometimes you don't like them, sometimes you don't notice, sometimes you're in a bad mood, whatever. So why would your character do it?

Lines like "He sees you looking at him and winks." are a common mistake. If you want to wink at everyone who looks at you, you can do that. Just wait till you see "&lt;Player> looks at you." and then respond. Not only does it allow you to modify the action based on context, but it cuts down the length of your description, making people more likely to read it.

==Adding a backstory, or why you shouldn't==

It is tempting to add a backstory in your description, but consider if it is really needed. A line such as "He was born in a public park and raised by wombles." might sound like a good idea but is it something that is immediately apparent when someone else looks at you?

It is best practice to keep your description to be about your physical features.

==Commands and getting creative==

You can set your description up in a variety of ways. From a simple description that never changes to one which automatically changes depending on what you are wearing.

The layout of your description will follow this order:
*Main
Followed by zones:
*Face 
*Hair
*Head
*Neck
*Chest
*Back
*Abdomen
*Arms
*Hands
*Legs
*Feet
*Eyes

Most players will be happy enough using just a main description, this will not change if you wear an item of clothing. This can be done with &lt;code>describe main &lt;description>&lt;/code>. 
By default your main description will begin with your characters pronoun (currently He/She/It) so it is beneficial to remember this when writing your main description. You can change this with the command &lt;code>describe main pronoun {on|off}&lt;/code>.

For zones you have the ability to describe both the area when it is covered by an item and when it is uncovered. This is especially useful for your head and face, for example you can write a description for your hair that is only visible when your head is uncovered.

If you do not set a description for a zone, either covered or uncovered, then no text will be displayed for that zone. This is useful if you want to write a description for a scar.

More flexibility for descriptions is given with the use of $NEW_LINE$ and $OBJECTS$. $NEW_LINE$ will insert a new line into your description, whilst $OBJECTS$ will list the worn item that is covering that zone.

As an example:

“He has a $OBJECTS$ on his head.” will result in  “He has a fur-lined elk skull helmet on his head.”

Changing this to “$OBJECTS$ adorns his head.” will result in “A fur-lined elk skull helmet adorns his head.”

Notice that the object is written exactly as it appears in your inventory and that the capitalisation of the first letter changes depending on if it is at the start of the sentence or not.

==Spellcheck==

The final thing you should do is check your description for spelling errors, typos, grammatical errors, etc. Of course, you should do this for any writing you intend others to read, but it's worth mentioning as it's so often overlooked.

=== Content from Writing ===

==Syntax==
&lt;pre>write with &lt;object> on &lt;object> in &lt;language>
write on &lt;object> with &lt;object> in &lt;language>
write with &lt;object> on &lt;object>
write on &lt;object> with &lt;object>&lt;/pre>
The "write" command will drop you into your chosen [[Special_interfaces#Editors|editor]] to write on the item.  You'll finish writing when you save--if you quit without saving, you won't actually write anything.

&lt;pre>scribble &lt;message> on &lt;object> with &lt;object>
scribble &lt;message> in &lt;language> on &lt;object> with &lt;object>&lt;/pre>
The "scribble" command lets you write one line on the item, immediately.

&lt;pre>sign &lt;object> with &lt;object>&lt;/pre>
The "sign" command adds a signature to the item.  It looks like this:
&lt;pre>Written in cursive &lt;ink> is the authentic and attested signature of &lt;your name>:
&lt;your name including title>&lt;/pre>

==Language==
Unless you otherwise specify the [[language]] you want to write in, you will write in the language you are currently speaking.  This is true for all of the writing commands.

When reading something in your native language, the writing looks like this:
&lt;pre>Written in &lt;ink>:&lt;/pre>
If it's in a language other than your native one, it looks like this:
&lt;pre>Written in &lt;ink> in &lt;language>:&lt;/pre>
Signatures also have the "in &lt;language>" bit added to them.

If you write something in a language you don't have a high enough level of written in, it may be partially unreadable even by someone with 100 levels of written in that language.  That is, parts of it may not translate properly.

==Writing instruments==
Some writing instruments need [[ink]]. For these, you need to get a bottle of ink, then "dip &lt;writing implement> {in|into} &lt;ink well>" before you can write with them. This does not consume any ink from the well, and the ink will remain indefinitely on the writing implement. You can "wipe &lt;writing implement>" to remove the ink from it (this is necessary to change colours).

When a pen, quill, or brush has ink, the appearance of the writing will include "&lt;colour>"--with the colour being, of course, the colour of the ink the writing instrument was dipped in.

When the appearance of the ink has a "&lt;description>" as part of it, this means that there's an adjective there that varies depending on your [[crafts.arts.calligraphy]] skill.  Some skill-based adjectives it's possible to get include:
* messy
* untidy
* simple
* neat
* elegant
* beautiful

== Tips &amp; Tricks ==

=== Extended Rows ===

Rows refers to the maximum number of lines of text the server will send before prompting you to either quit displaying text or continue.  Its designed to prevent especially long blocks of text from scrolling right up your screen.  Probably you will want to read the text, but you can force the server to send much larger blocks of text, to avoid that continue prompt.  

use "rows 30" or
use "rows 500"

=== Brief &amp; Verbose ===

The same text that creates the detailed environment we find ourselves within can be the very source of our frustrations, as we move around. Fortunately, we can set options to reduce such descriptive text until such time as we feel the need for more detail. The "brief" and "verbose" commands allow us to force the server to send exactly which level of description we want from an assortment of differnt events. 

The following headings are found under the brief and verbose commands:
combat, quit, tell, look, temperature, ignore, score, money, gp, names, count, exits, htell, errorreply, syntax, finger, purse, errors, and time 

Use "brief all" to set everything listed to brief. 

Most screen reader users will set "brief look" to force the server to minimize details as we enter a new room.  Most, but not all, items in a room will be named in brief.  That is enough to navigate, and using the "look" command will give a full description whenever you find a spot of interest.  

In most cases, the brief settings only prevent the automatic text sent to you from being as lengthy as it might be.  There is nothing ttruely hidden from you, because you only need to use another command to request the full details.  

Another related setting not yet moved into the brief headings is "suppress_evade".  Turning this option on will reduce your combat messages even further, by no longer showing you when you managed to avoid being hit.  

Use "options combat  suppress_evade"

=== Listing Skills ===

The "skills" command is used to display a very long array of your advancement in groups of learned skills.  You will use this command frequently, and the information it displays is important.  Unfortunately, the default setting allows the skills to be displayed in a visually pleasing branching layout.  Trying to read these branches is a nightmare for screen readers, so the option to force skills to be displayed in a simple long list is absolutely necessary.  

Use "options output skills = list"

=== Map Text ===

The 'map text' and 'map door text' commands will provide you with a written description of the rooms surrounding you, mentioning any NPCs or exits they contain. They can be quite spammy, but are also quite helpful to get a feel for your surroundings. You can set the map to always show up as text with "options output map written=on" or "options output map written=door". 

=== Useing Aliases ===

Aliases allow you to write and store one or more commands under a name specified by you, allowing you to then execute those commands by typing the name.  This saves a lot of time and effort typing out complete commands. 

The [[alias]] page contains various aliases which may be useful for all players.  

==  Projects ==

There are several blind and low vision players within the Discworld community.  Many of those, along with sighted guide players, are glad to provide whatever advice and tools are required for everyone to continue enjoying the game.  

=== Using VipMud Client on Discworld ===

A script package for the  [[VipMud MUD Client]] has been developed to provide blind and low vision players of Discworld extensive text to speech support and specialized tools for accessibility. Details about the package, as well as links for downloads can be found in the [[DiscworldTTS for VipMud]] section.

== External Links ==

The following sections describe websites other than this WIKI offering tools and information especially useful to blind and low vision players of the Discworld MUD.  

=== Searching Map Text ===

the [https://dw.daftjunk.com/search.php Map Text Search Page] of Kefka's Map site allows you to search for text (e.g. a street name) within graphical maps. Resulting matches are highlighted on the graphical map, as well as being described in text. It helps to have a general idea of the layout of an area before trying to use this technique to find a specific location.

In cities which are generally circular, the textual result is described as a clock bearing and percentage from the centre of the city. For example, a search for a street name of "whopp" in the Ankh-Morpork map finds Whopping Street at "8 o'clock, 85% out from centre", indicating that it is in the southwest of the city, quite close to the outer edge of it. 

In cities/terrain areas which are rectangular, the map is divided into nine sections - northwest, north, northeast, etc, and the textual result says which one a match was found in. For example, a search for a street name of "pang" in the Bes Pelargic map finds Pang Ho "In the northwest section of the area."

The search results also give the X,Y pixel co-ordinates of any matches, and the dimensions of the complete map.  

=== Street Finder ===

The [http://dw.jasonsw.com/index.php?title=Main_Page Discworld MUD Street Finder Wiki] states as it's goal to "outline every street in all of the major cities (AM, BP, DJB), in order to facilitate some sort of a working map of the Disc for the blind".

==Getting Started==
These tips should make it easier for a vision-impaired player to start out on the MUD, via things such as reducing the amount of text generated.

* The 'rows' command lets you control how many lines of text the MUD will send you in one block.  If the MUD wishes to send something longer than your limit, you will receive a prompt to press return/enter to continue.  With your rows set to a low/the default value, this often happens in the middle of long help files, shop stock listings, etc.  If you would rather not be prompted to continue, type 'rows 500' (or another large number) to raise the line limit.

* If room descriptions are too lengthy for your liking, type 'brief look' to only be given the short version.  You can type 'look' to see the full room description on demand, or type 'verbose look' to switch back to showing the full descriptions by default.  While short descriptions may be quicker and easier, a lot of atmosphere and flavour will be lost.

* The 'brief' and 'verbose' commands can toggle the verbosity of more than room descriptions - type either command by itself to see the list of things it can control and what you have them set to, and type the command followed by the thing you wish to change in order to do so.  For example, 'brief names' will set player names to brief mode.  'brief combat' will strip out any inconsequential combat messages (such as attacks that are defended against).

* By default, the 'skills' command which is used to check your skills and bonuses displays this information in a branched layout which can cause havoc with screen readers.  Type 'options output skills = list' to make the command display the information in a reader-friendly list.

* The 'map text' and 'map door text' commands will provide you with a written description of the rooms surrounding you, mentioning any NPCs or exits they contain.  They can be quite spammy, but are also quite helpful to get a feel for your surroundings. You can set the map to always show up as text with "[[options]] output map written=on" or "[[options]] output map written=door".

* A player-run club named 'wayfinders' exists, which is dedicated to increasing accessibility and helping vision-impaired players.  The command 'finger wayfinders' will give you information about the club and its members.  Contact one of the recruiters if you wish to join the club.

=== Content from Bank ===

There is a one-time fee to open an account, and a deposit fee every time you make a deposit (a percentage of the amount of the deposit).

If you have an account at a bank, you can access your balance from any of its branches.  You deposit and withdraw money in the local currency only.

The command "balance book", used at any bank (whether npc or player-run), will give you a book that lists all of your bank accounts and their balances.  If you already have a balance book in your inventory, this updates it for free--if not, there's a fee of {{dollars|A$5}} to get a new book.

The balances are listed both in the currency each bank uses&lt;ref>As determined by each bank's main branch.&lt;/ref>, and in the local currency of the bank branch you last updated the balance book at.  The last page tells you the total amount of money you have across all accounts.

==NPC banks==
There's no limit to the amount of money npc banks can hold, and they are permanent.  However, they usually have higher deposit fees than player-run banks.

==Player-run banks==
Bank counters of different capacities can be installed in [[player shops]].  Since they can only hold a certain amount of money, they must be maintained to make sure people can deposit and withdraw money.

While the shop in which the master counter is on auction operations on accounts cannot be made at the master bank counter, though it is still possible to withdraw and deposit money in accounts at branch counters.

If the master counter is trashed the accounts become unavailable until a new master counter with the same bank name is put back in the same shop. This probably also stops branch counters from working.{{research}}

The shop owner can set the deposit fees and the fees to open an account.  The deposit rate is visible when you look at the counter:
{{Prebox|A heavily armoured and hardwood counter with a safe embedded into the surface.  A logo marks this as a franchise of [bank].
&lt;br>A small sign indicates that the current deposit rate is [rate] and the owner is [owner].}}

[[Category:Facilities]]

=== Content from Buying_lives ===

You start with 7 lives for free without having to do anything. Hurray! You can check this with the [[score]] command.

There are several methods to buy new lives: tossing royals to [[Pishe]] at her pool in her waterpark in [[Ankh-Morpork]], tossing money in Pishe's pool in [[Lancre]] or through the Golden Chicken in [[Bes Pelargic]].

Offering money to Pishe is reliable &amp; straightforward but expensive, while the egg process, while potentially cheaper, takes more time and it can fail for several reasons even if you do everything you can.

==Pishe's Temple (Ankh Morpork)==

===Where===

At Pishe's Pool, which is located in the Temple of [[Pishe]], in the [[Pishe Waterpark|Apothecary Gardens]], in Ankh Morpork.

Directions from outside The Mended Drum:

4 west, 5 north (crossing Contract Bridge), west, north, northwest, 2 north, 4 northeast, northwest, north, northeast, 2 northwest, north, 2 northwest (crossing Lost Bridge), north, 2 northwest, southwest (into Apothecary Gardens), west, west (into temple), northwest (into life pool).

Note - entering the temple costs 1p per guild level except for adventurers, ghosts and Pishites.

The "Slide of restoration" is found from life pool: southeast, up

===Help file===

Part of help file in room with "Slide of restoration":

     Buying Lives &lt;BR>
     Lives can now be purchased in the natural rock pool northwest of the main entrance to the      
     Pishe Gardens.  To see how to do this, use 'syntax toss' while in the room.  Lives are
     slightly cheaper for priests of Pishe. &lt;BR>
     
     Note that you need to be at full strength to buy lives.  There is a means, somewhere in
     the garden, to restore yourself to your full ability. 

===How===

You buy lives by tossing royals into the pool. The syntax is:

 toss &lt;1 royal / n royals> into pool

Most people toss a single royal at a time, until they receive a life. This is indicated with a message such as:

&lt;div style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;color:white;background-color:black;padding:1em;border:medium inset grey">
Saving...&lt;br>
&lt;span style="color:yellow">You feel like you have more life.&lt;/span>&lt;br>
Pishe smiles on you and lifts the clouds from your heart, but the moment has been draining. Some rest will probably help.
&lt;/div>

The pool seems to have some memory and will remember for a time, no-one knows how long it seems, if you have to go away and get more royals part way through the process. However, most people prefer to make sure they bring plenty with them.

===Cost===

It varies. Random numbers, the phases of the moon, your guild level, how long since you last bought a life? Who knows (apart from the Cre's)? The following are based on my own perception:

* It seems to get more expensive with each life.
* It seems to be roughly Number of Lives Bought so far, divided by 5, in royals, with fluctuations of about 20% either side.
* It might be cheaper if you allow a bit of time between buying lives.
* The cheapest solution is to not die.
* It's cheaper for Pishites.

...or... you could consider Sined's calculation. Archived copy : {{SERVER}}/sined/priest/newlifes.htm

* Number of Deaths so far, or Number of Lives Bought so far, divided by 5, in royals, +-20%.
You can calculate these minimum and maximum with the following equations:
 math NUMBER / 5 * 0.8
 math NUMBER / 5 * 1.2
Replace NUMBER with your deaths, the number after &lt;code>You have died&lt;/code> in &lt;code>score&lt;/code>.
*Alternatively, if you want to calculate your lives bought so far : &lt;code>deaths + times you can die in score - 7&lt;/code> (initial number of lives)

===Warning===

Remember that message above? Where it said "But the moment has been draining. Some rest will probably help." .... it wasn't kidding. Your [[constitution]] stat has dropped several levels. It will come back up over time, or with a "[[restore]]" ritual from a Pishe priest. (You can also get a restore by sliding down the slide in the tree, see [[Buying lives#Slide of restoration | below section]]) Your con stat is the largest part of your [[HP]], so you have low HP after this. In addition, you may not have enough con to buy another life straight away. If you try, this happens:

&lt;pre>You consider tossing one Ankh-Morpork royal into the pool, but decide to wait and get your strength back first.&lt;/pre>

===Slide of restoration===

Remember to '''pay respects to Pishe''' or else you will hurt yourself sliding down a dry slide

You will need at least 20 dollars to pay respects

&lt;pre>
 pay respects to Pishe
 You place some coins in the rain cloud above the slide.  The cloud darkens slightly, as though heavy with rain.

 slide down [water] slide {sitting|headfirst}

 Heavy raindrops start to fall from the cloud and pour down the slide.
 You cautiously sit on the top of the slide before gathering the courage to let go.
 The water rushing around you quickly propels you downwards to the pool below.
 As the restorative water rushing down the slide engulfs you, you feel your health return to you.
 As your journey down the slide comes to a finish you fly off the end and splash into the water of the pool.
&lt;/pre>

There is a [[adventuring.acrobatics.balancing]] skillcheck for this and you don't get the restore if you fail it. &lt;!--At lesat 115 in skill ad.ac.bal seems to be successfull-->

Without paying respects, you get hurt sliding down (about 50 hp).
 You run up and leap onto the slide, realising too late that there is no water on it!
 You painfully make your way down, exposed skin being scraped cruely by the dry wood.
 Finally you reach the end of your journey and fall into the pool with a splash.

==Pishe's Pool (Lancre)==

You can also buy lives at the pool of Pishe's Temple in Lancre Kingdom, a few miles north of [[Lancre Town]].

===Where===

From [[Lancre Town]], journey northeast, then journey north from the intersection, then journey west from the intersection, then go south four times. The room also contains a [[Pishe]] high altar, and there is a hut with a Pishite religious instructor just east of it. 

===How===

The pool accepts donations of Lancre sovereigns (and larger denominations of Lancrastian currency) and as a basic calculation, two sovereigns are roughly equivalent to one royal. The pool responds to "syntax offer".

If you donate smaller denominations of Lancre currency, you may receive healing if you are in need of it, but it is not known if such donations are also credited towards a life or not.

There does not seem to be any link between the two locations, in that money offered at either for a life does not count towards the cost at the other one.

This pool also appears to remember partial donations, like the Ankh-Morpork one the duration of such memories is unknown.

The caveats about your [[constitution]] dropping apply here as well.

==Golden chicken==
In Bes Pelargic there is a Golden Chicken that wanders randomly. If you feed it enough chicken logs (purchased from a stall in the High Tide Road covered market) it can then be squeezed to lay an egg.  If you then follow the egg around hugging, kissing, and cuddling it, it eventually hatches and you gain a life.  If the egg is not catered to promptly and consistently, it breaks and is lost.

Typically it takes between 5 and 12 logs to get the chicken completely stuffed so it can lay an egg.  The logs cost {{rhinu|8Rh 40s}} each, so this is usually much cheaper than buying lives from Pishe (and there is no stat reduction when using this method).  However, it is much more time consuming and there is no guarantee it will be successful (e.g. the egg might roll into water and die, through no fault of and with no recourse for the player).

Success looks like this:

 Belias's egg wobbles.
 Belias's egg wobbles alarmingly.
 Belias's egg wobbles slightly.
 A small crack appears on the surface of Belias's egg, which grows and spreads.
 Suddenly, the shell explodes in a burst of flame and vanishes, a bird-like
 form flying upwards out of the blast. The fiery bird spreads its wings and
 silently dissipates.
 You feel curiously full of vitality and life.

Failure can look like this:

 Sorae's egg wobbles sadly.
 Sorae's egg dies.
 A small crack appears on the surface of Sorae's egg, which grows and spreads until finally the entire shell collapses, yolk and egg white pouring everywhere from within.
 With a sense of terrible sadness, you realise that your egg has tragically perished, the wonderful life within that could have been, no more.

At the beginning, it takes 20 to 30 minutes of chasing and pandering to the egg before it hatches. This time will increase as the number of lives you've successfully chased increases. At around 120 lives successfully chased, the time before the egg hatches is around 70 minutes.

The egg moves 7 to 11 rooms at a time, after each interaction where you either hug, cuddle or kiss it.  It appears to pick the direction randomly from any exit in the room, visible or not (with a bias against going back the way it just came).  It will enter stores, playerhouses and family estates.

The egg can be successfully trapped in a playerhouse for the duration of the chase if it wanders in and the playerhouse is locked in time, but it can not be a one room house. The egg has to be able to roll around, even if it's only back and forth in a two room house.

It is unclear if it can be pursued successfully with the [[pursue]] command - it seems to easily evade pursuit with low to moderate bonuses, at least.

Warriors are able to [[track]] the scent of the egg, though more research may have to be done to confirm how well the tracking works.

 track egg
 You inspect your surroundings and have few doubts that Ownerless egg went east just moments ago.

It can be prevented from using an exit with [[guard]], but this makes it unhappy and risks it breaking.  This is still worth doing, however, for exits that will be fatal to the egg (e.g. entrances to waterways).

The egg does not show up through map door text, making it harder to track than normal NPCs.

The best places to work with the egg are large open spaces, such as Dragon Head Square or the Square of a Thousand Parades.  The movement of the egg in nearby rooms will be shown, making it easier to follow its rapid movement, and these locations have no natural hazards that can kill the egg (such as water).  There is little you can do to control the location in general, but if the chicken or egg are already near these locations, use of [[guard]] (or similar) can herd them in the right direction.

=== Content from Coin ===

==Weight==
Coins are a [[continuous item]], and one coin weighs 5 grams. This means that 10 coins weigh 1/9 lb. and 90 coins weigh 1 lb.

==Inventory==
Money in your inventory does not count against the 10 items limit for fumbling or the 50 items limit.

If however you have 50 items in your inventory, making you unable to take any more items, then you can't take any more money either.

==Types of coins==
Types and values of coins are listed under [[currency]].  You can withdraw specific types of coins from [[bank]]s&lt;ref>As detailed in {{Devblog|118 this blog post}}.&lt;/ref> and you can also change between different denominations, or between different regions, at a [[money changer]].

==Flipping coins==
You can "flip" a coin.  To do this, you need to specify the type of coin you want to flip.

The normal result is that it lands on the floor, either tails up or heads up.
&lt;pre>>flip shilling
You flip one Lancre shilling.
One Lancre shilling falls on the floor, tails up.&lt;/pre>

However, in areas wth high [[background magic]], the results are different (and usually result in the loss of the coin):
&lt;pre>Something really, really strange happens.&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>One Ankh-Morpork penny sparkles and turns into a small yellow caterpillar.&lt;/pre>
The [[small yellow caterpillar]] is the same type that can result from [[Brother Happalon's Elementary Enchanting]].
&lt;pre>One Ankh-Morpork penny lands on its edge.
How curious.&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>One Ankh-Morpork penny spins slowly in mid-air, then vanishes with a small "pop!"&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>With a small gout of flame, one Djelian ptascp begins to accelerate.
One Djelian ptascp vanishes into the distance.&lt;/pre>

Coins that disappear in this way will send a chat to a random player that something zooms past their ear at high speed.

&lt;pre>You flip one Djelian ptascp.
Balefire blossoms, and one Djelian ptascp turns into a bunch of flowers.&lt;/pre>
The [[flowers]] are the same type you get from [[Eringyas' Surprising Bouquet]].
&lt;pre>One Genuan cent vanishes with a sharp "spang!"
A moment later, you hear a small thunderclap.&lt;/pre>

==Coins and containers==
Historically, there have been problems with coins in containers and vaults vanishing unexpectedly, leading it to being made impossible to ''put'' coins in them for a few years.  It was made possible again sometime in March 2009&lt;ref>As archived in [https://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/secure/newspaper.c?type=edition&amp;paper=AM+Daily&amp;edition=105 this edition of the AM Daily]&lt;/ref>.

==Coin descriptions==
The carried currency is made of real coins that usually have something on both sides.

===Provincial===

Provincial currency has been out of game since the early to mid 00s, but used to be found primarily in the Sto Plains and could be withdrawn from the bank in Hillshire. It's possible the "a head" and "a tail" face designs are simply the defaults for the reverse and obverse, used if no other designs are specified - again, note its appearance on the Klatchian thousand-dinar coin.

=== Content from Crafts ===

There are a wide array of [[crafts]] one can engage in on the MUD.  Crafts activities make use of skills in the crafts tree - hence, actions like tracking and bandaging are included below.  Some crafts may require little or low level craft skills to perform, or only need skills for a small part of the process.  They have been included if they seem "crafty" enough.

Many crafts make use of special items called [[:Category:Craft_supplies|craft supplies]].
