=== Content from Stunnel ===

It is a sort of proxy designed to add TLS encryption functionality to existing clients and servers without any changes in the programs' code. It is designed for security, portability, and scalability (including load-balancing), making it suitable for large deployments. It uses OpenSSL, and distributed under GNU GPL version 2 or later with OpenSSL exception.

Put another way, it allows you to connect your [[Mud client]] to a Mud through SSL encryption (if that mud provides a SSL port).
*This makes it much harder to intercept your mud password and everything you type and see through your mud client as it is otherwise sent in the clear through the internet.

==Installation==
*Windows: see https://mushclient.com/mushclient/stunnel.htm
*Arch distros: &lt;code>pacman -S stunnel&lt;/code>
*Debian / Ubuntu: &lt;code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install stunnel4&lt;/code>

==Configuration==

Sample stunnel.conf configuration files for Discworld mud:

===Encrypted but not secure===
stunnel does not automatically validate server certificates for client connections. To encrypt data between your computer and the server, but still be susceptible to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack MITM attacks]:
&lt;pre>
[Discworld]
client = yes
connect = discworld.starturtle.net:4245
accept = localhost:4245
&lt;/pre>

===Secure===
On Windows stunnel cannot use the operating system's certificate store, so to have a truly secure connection you must:
* Export/save the certificate chain starting from the parent certificate of discworld.starturtle.net (currently labelled R10) and including it's signing root CA (currently labelled ISRG Root X1). Make sure to select the option that exports the whole chain to the root certificate in Base64-encoded ASCII and save the file as dwcachain.crt and move it to the location of the stunnel binary.
* Use the following configuration:
&lt;pre>
[Discworld]
client = yes
accept = localhost:4245
connect = discworld.starturtle.net:4245
CAfile = dwcachain.crt
verifyChain = yes
checkHost = discworld.starturtle.net
&lt;/pre>
Note: Every time the discworld server changes who issues its certificates, the certifying authority changes the certificate chain path or any of the certificate authorities' certificates expire (currently slated for March 2027) you will have to manually update the certificate chain.

==Running==
*Windows: Clicking on the executable with the OpenSSL DLLs and the stunnel.conf in the same directory should work.
*Linux manually: &lt;code>stunnel stunnel.conf&lt;/code> (adjust to path of &lt;code>stunnel.conf&lt;/code> if not in the current directory)
*Linux systemd: &lt;code>service stunnel4 start&lt;/code> (by default should use config file &lt;code>/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf&lt;/code>)

==[[MUSHclient]]==

The following page contains information to prepare and start Stunnel with Mushclient on windows to connect with SSL.
* https://mushclient.com/mushclient/stunnel.htm

You can follow the steps on the page linked above to download stunnel and install it, you can use the following configuation information for Discworld mud:

Then in Mushclient you can edit your world information (Alt+1) to connect to the TCP/IP Address: localhost and Port 4245.


If the connection doesn't work it probably means stunnel is not currently running.
*You can setup stunnel to start with your computer or start it manually.

==Alternatives==
The MUSHclient author suggests using the TorBrowser as a proxy instead of Stunnel.

=== Content from Syntax ===

Note that different syntaxes might belong to different commands with the same name.

If syntax does not return anything useful you might not have the item or you might not be in the correct room that adds the command you are looking for, or perhaps you need to try synonyms.

Most commands, objects or rooms also have [[help file]]s, it's worth a try, but all commands have one or more syntax.

An example of the use of the syntax command:
----
> '''put knife inside knapsack'''

See "syntax put" for the input patterns.

> '''syntax put'''

Forms of syntax available for the command 'put':

put &lt;object> {in|on|into} &lt;object>

> '''say Aha!'''

You exclaim: Aha!

> '''put knife in knapsack'''

You put the knife in a pocket in the knapsack.

> '''beam'''

You beam brightly.

=== Content from Talker ===

A '''talker''' is an item that gives you access to various channels.  You can use them to talk to people (anyone who is listening to the channel).

==Channels==
There are several channels, with different purposes.  The command "&lt;tt>talker channels&lt;/tt>" will show you which ones you have access to.

Creators have access to channels whether or not they fit the criteria for being on the channel (being in a specific guild, etc.).

===One===
One is the channel for general chatter.  Everyone has access to it, and it's generally fairly busy.

===Two===
Two is for singing, and [[Sokkard]]'s various stories, and sometimes random chatter as well.  Everyone has access to it, but it's not nearly as busy as One.

===Inews===
Everyone has access to this channel, which exists for the purpose of discussing the news.  Once upon a time news feeds from different sources were shown here.

===Igame===

  (Igame) Pit: People use the channel to talk about missions.
  (Igame) Nuala: Stallone unless I've got this very wrong it's for people to chat about m...ahh what Pit said
  (Igame) Pit: Some may also like to use it to ask for help for quests (spoiler-free plz!) and achievements.
  (Igame) Stallone: ahhhh thankd
  (Igame) Mauve: And other game stuff.
  (Igame) Tomt: Pit any ideas on the etymology?
  (Igame) Pit: Mind you, that wasn't what the channel was made for.
  (Igame) Shand perks up and listens intently
  (Igame) Pit: Originally, this was a channel like quiz, but shared with other MUDs. However, it ended up not really being used, and the connection with other MUDs was dropped, so some players decided to appropriate it.
  (Igame) Pit: And turned it into the official missions channel.
  (Igame) Pit: While creator stood by and said "hmmmm, let's see whether this clever player-initiative actually *works*"
  (Igame) Stallone: then what is intermud
  (Igame) Shand: terrible?
  (Igame) Stallone is so confused.
  (Igame) Pit: And then sometime later we said "you know, we should probably remove the remaining intermud-connections, we keep getting runtimes".
  (Igame) Pit: Intermud is for talking to other MUDs.
  (Igame) Pit: Igame was for playing games with them.
  (Igame) Pit: While inews is for receiving news. That one isn't for talking to other MUDs, though, as they can't hear you.
  (Igame) Pit: (Even though we can hear them.)
  (Igame) Stallone: we can??? spooky
  (Igame) Pit: Well, I don't think those other muds are really using it either.  ;)
  (Igame) Stallone: so much unused code and unseen content in the mud sometimes it makes me feel very small
  (Igame) Stallone snaps out of it

=== Content from Terrains ===

Terrains, and the npcs in them, tend to be more similar between different types of terrain in the same general area as each other (for example, between plains and deciduous forest in the [[Ramtops]]) than between similarly-named types of terrain in different areas (for example, plains in the [[Sto Plains]] versus plains in the [[Ramtops]]).

Most terrains change a bit according to the [[calendar|season]]--having different appearances and room chats (with some npcs changing somewhat to match)--and, to a lesser extent, according to whether it's day or night, so the keen explorer will be rewarded for visiting the various areas at different times.

[[File:697px-Discwhole.png|thumb|link={{filepath:Discwhole.png}}|Unified terrains map of the entire playable Disc, compiled by Quow in 2018 for the Cow bar v3.6 "Explorer's Edition" update to the plugins, for complete mapping around the entire Disc.]]

==How terrains work==
It's important to realize that terrains are much more continuous than cities, and that their scale is different.  Each room is a square mile instead of being, well, room-sized (or at least, rooms are a mile apart), and you can generally go in any of the eight usual directions&lt;ref>In other words: North, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.&lt;/ref> unless there's some sort of boundary there--even if it isn't listed as an obvious exit--because there's generally nothing to logically ''stop'' you from wandering in any direction.

===The map===
The full ASCII [[map (command)|map]], too, has a different appearance in the terrains, reflecting their more continuous nature.  In the daytime, in clear weather and with no obstacles, it's a circle extending ten rooms away from you in every direction, but--as in cities--things can restrict your view.  Snow or sleet in particular contract the circle, and in certain types of terrain your view is blocked by natural obstacles: in forests you'll have difficulty seeing very far into the trees, and in mountainous regions it's difficult to see uphill.  You also cannot see around cities.  Bridges, on the other hand, are generally a bit higher than the surrounding terrain and will let you see over these types of obstacles (although, being higher, they can block your view the same way a city does).

Living things are represented with the @ character, and your own will be yellow (if you have [[colour]] enabled) and in the center of the map.  As in cities, the full map will have a key indicating what the symbols mean--terrain types, roads, bridges, cities, etc.

===Journeying===
In terrains you can move usually several rooms in one go--this is called journeying.  For example, if you're on a road, the exits will normally be journey exits (although you can still take non-journey exits), and journeying will generally take you either eleven rooms (miles) along the room.  The exception is if you journey into an intersection, or a room without another journey exit (bridges are walked onto normally, not journeyed through), in which case you'll stop there.  This means that you don't generally need to worry about going past the turning you want.

If you're not on a road, you'll most usually go either six rooms in your chosen direction--and you ''can'' journey to the northeast, southeast, northwest, or southwest, even though these are not listed as options--or until you reach a room without a journey exit in the direction you're going, or a different short description (so, "An edge of plains near a stand of trees" is different from "Some plains").  You may not be able to journey in certain directions when near boundaries between types of terrains.

Whenever you journey more than one room, you're told the directions you went (well, skipped over, since you jump directly to your destination room without loading or interacting with the ones in-between).

Journeying is generally not an option in forests, jungles, mountainous regions, and water--only on roads and in more wide-open types of terrains.

You can opt to automatically journey instead of walking one room at a time (when the exit you're taking has that as an option) by setting "[[Options#Personal|options personal travel]]" to "journey", and stop doing that by setting it back to "walk". (If it's set to walk, you have to specifically choose to journey a direction; just typing "north", etc., will only take you one room north.)

===Finding your way===
The latter part of the long description of a terrain room will give you a general idea of what major features (cities, roads, water, terrain types, and mountains) are nearby, and the approximate direction and distance.

If you have a physical in-game [[map (item)|map]] for the area you're in and some [[adventuring.direction]], you can also consult it, study it, or locate particular features on it to get an idea of where you are--though with low skills this idea can be somewhat inaccurate.

The [[Find]] ritual, if you have it, can also be helpful--[[fly-tos|npcs that can be flown to]] generally make good targets for the ritual, and will help you orient yourself in respect to a particular city or village.

You can also consult Quow's [[Media:Discwhole.png|unified terrains map of the entire playable Disc]] to find your way or use his [https://quow.co.uk/minimap.php minimap plugin] with MUSH client to see the map in a window.

===Tracking===
The [[track]] command works differently in the terrains than in cities{{Research}}.

==Terrain types==
There are five broad (land-based) areas: [[Klatch]], the [[Sto Plains]], the [[Ramtops]], [[Uberwald]], and [[CWC]] (or the Counterweight Continent).  However, Uberwald and CWC generally have the same sort of terrains as the [[Ramtops]] area (the main exception being the Uberwald forest).

There are also a few major bodies of water.  The [[Circle Sea]] is just west of [[Ankh-Morpork]] and the Sto Plains.  The [[Turnwise Ocean]] is to the northeast of the Ramtops, and the port city [[Bes Pelargic]] is at its edge.  [[Thursday's Island]] is also in this ocean.  The [[Widershins Ocean]] is directly to the east of the Ramtops/Uberwald area, and is basically southish of the Turnwise Ocean.  A land bridge and glacial area divides the Widershins and Turnwise oceans.  Finally the [[Agatean Sea]] is to the northeastish of the same land bridge.

===Klatch===
Klatch borders the Circle Sea on its west side, as well as the Sto Plains.  It extends north, west, and south to the borders of the map.  Its most notable city is [[Djelibeybi]], which is very close to the west side of the Circle Sea, although it also contains the [[Chronides Farmstead]] and [[Imtebos farmstead]].  It has the following terrains and areas:
*[[Water pastures]] along the [[Djel River]], close to Djelibeybi.
*[[Farms]] around Djelibeybi and the [[Chronides Farmstead]].
*[[Sandy beach]]es and [[rocky shore]]s, which are of course next to the ocean.
*Extensive [[grassy plains]] and [[savanna]] throughout.
*The [[Ephebian Desert]] south of Djelibeybi and extending to the west.  The [[Oasis]] is in this desert, roughly west-southwest of [[Djelibeybi]].
*The [[Tsortean Desert]] north of Djelibeybi and extending to the west. The [[Klatchian Foreign Legion]] is in this desert, roughly northwest of [[Djelibeybi]].
*Small [[stands of trees]] scattered throughout.
*A few [[jungle]]s and [[rainforest]]s
*[[Mountains]]&lt;!--check to see what they're called-->
*A [[swamp]] beyond the Tsortean Desert.

===Sto Plains===
The Sto Plains border the Circle Sea on its east side, as well as Klatch.  They extend to the north to the border of the map, to the south to some mountains&lt;!--Ramtops?-->, and to the Ramtops region to the east.  The most major cities here are [[Ankh-Morpork]] and, slightly to the east, [[Sto Lat]], but there are several small villages and towns in the general area.  It has the following terrains and areas:
*[[Plains|Plains]], naturally, all around.
*[[Cabbage fields]]--miles and miles of cabbage fields--surrounding Ankh-Morpork and extending east to the Carrack Mountains.
*[[Rocky beach]]es, [[rocky shore]]s, and [[cliffs]] which are of course next to the ocean.
*Small clumps of [[forest]] scattered throughout, and larger areas of forest to the west and south of Skund Forest, and in the far south.
*The [[Carrack Mountains]], a mountain range approximately a hundred miles wide (from east to west) and around three hundred and sixty miles long (from north to south).  Despite being "mountainous" terrain, the slopes are shallow enough not to require climbing.
*The [[Morpork Mountains]], a mountain range starting to the southwest of Ankh-Morpork and extending some three hundred miles in a mostly southerly direction.  Like the Carrack Mountains, no climbing is required here.  The [[Capture the Flag]] arena is located on the east edge, at the end of a road, and [[Nowhere]] is located on the east side, at the end of a different road.
*[[Skund Forest]] starts around the south end of the Carrack Mountains and extends to the south.
*An unnamed [[hilly mountain range]] of the same type as the Morpork and Carrack Mountains lies to the far south, at the edge of the map.

===Ramtops and Uberwald===
The Ramtops and Uberwald area is to the east of the Sto Plains.  It extends north and south to the borders of the map and east to the Widdershins Ocean.  The areas of greatest interest are [[Lancre]] with its several towns and villages as well as [[Gloomy Forest]], and [[Uberwald]], a largish forested area to the far south of Lancre, reached by way of the King's Road and surrounded by mountains.  The area largely consists of the [[Ramtops Mountains]], although there are other terrains and areas there, mixed throughout:
*[[Plains]]
*[[Deciduous forest]], [[evergreen forest]], and [[mixed forest]]
*[[Meadow]]s
*Some [[marshland]], which the road to the Sto Plains goes through
*[[Uberwald forest]] ("Dark forest"), which is, of course, in Uberwald, and contains [[Escrow]], [[Magpyr Castle]], the [[Unnamed Town]], and [[Dave's swamp]].
*[[Moorland]], with the largest area of it being to the east of the mountains, far past Uberwald.  The [[Hublandish Barbarians]]' winter camp is here, near the inaccessible Fiddlyfjord.
*[[Rocky beach]]es and [[seashore]]s along the Turnwise Ocean and inlets.
*[[Ice land|Ice lands]] to the east of the mountains, leading into [[glacier]] and then the land bridge to the Counterweight Continent.

The [[Hub]] is also here, approximately nine hundred miles directly east from Lancre.

===CWC===
Past the glacial area is the Counterweight Continent.  Most of the continent is inaccessible or nonexistent, but there are still several areas of land terrain outside the Wall.  [[Bes Pelargic]] is here.  Terrains include:
*[[Moorland]] on the land bridge
*[[Plains]]
*[[Deciduous forest]]
*[[Meadow]]s
*[[Seashore]]s and [[sandy beach]]es along the edges of the land.

These terrains are much like their Ramtops equivalents, but the only human npcs on the continent are in Bes Pelargic and the Tuna Bay [[Fish]] temple.

===Jogloran's Portal of Cheaper Travel===

Wizards are able to [[Al'Hrahaz's Scintillating Blorpler|enchant jewellery]] and [[Amazing_Silicate_Blorpler|enchant rocks]] to remember a room (creating a [[blorple]]), and can then cast Jogloran's Portal of Cheaper Travel on a blorple to open a temporary one-way link to the room. Non-wizards with sufficient magic skills are able to cast Jogloran's Portal of Cheaper Travel from [[scrolls]] made by wizards. Anybody in the room where a portal is opened can use it.

Blorples can be exchanged between wizards, and are often sold in player shops.

For more information, see [[Jogloran's Portal of Cheaper Travel]].


===Divine Hand===

Similar to blorples, Priests can perform [[remember place]] on most items, as long as they are consecrated to their god. Priests can then perform Divine Hand on these items, allowing them (and anyone following them) to move into their deity's passage room, and then straight into the room linked to their item. Non-priests with sufficient [[faith.rituals.misc.target]] bonus are able to perform Divine Hand with the help of a properly prepared [[faith rods|faith rod]], and will also cost [[deity points]]. All performers of the ritual must have a [[holy symbol]]. Unlike Jogloran's Portal of Cheaper Travel, only the performer of the ritual and anybody following them can make use of the teleport.

Unlike blorples, items affected by remember place are personal and cannot be shared between players. Non-priests are required to make their own items with remember place, and will need a faith rod with remember place to do this.

It is worth noting that obtaining and maintaining a usable faith rod can be excessively expensive for non-priests.

For more information, see [[Divine Hand]].


===Visit===

Hat Priests can use the visit ritual to be teleported straight to a random player on the disc. There is no way to target this ritual, and it can often end up placing the user in dangerous situations. Non-Hattians can use a faith rod to make use of this ritual. Performers of the ritual must have sufficient [[faith.rituals.misc.self]], a holy symbol and some alcohol.

This ritual is a good way to obtain the misportalling achievements, but as with Divine Hand, faith rods can be expensive for non-hattians wishing to use the ritual many times.

For more information, see [[Visit]]


===Broomstick===

Witches can use their broomsticks to fly to many named NPCs around the disc. The broomstick requires fuel (in the form of guild points). Sufficient [[adventuring.direction]] skill is needed to avoid misfights.

For more information, see [[Broomstick]]


===Arcane Transport NPC===

In major towns, there are NPCs that, for a small fee ($20 for international travel), will teleport players to other major towns. The major towns that contain these NPCs (and are also possible destinations) are Ankh-Morpork, Bes Pelargic, Djelibeybi, Ephebe, Genua and Ohulan-Cutash. 

It has been reported that speaking the local language is a requirement (under 36 levels of spoken has been verified to work).

===Ferries===

There are a few ferries on the disc, most being very similar to carriages. Ferries can be found in Ankh-Morpork's east and west ends, crossing the Ankh, and Bes Pelargic's river, connecting the Bad Poo-Ning, Imperial, Sum Bing and the Shoo-li districts.

The inter-city routes are as follows:

==Other==

There are other ways to travel the disc that aren't as common. 


===Walking===

Every town is connected by roads and [[terrains]]. It's absolutely possible to walk (and swim!) from Djelibeybi all the way to Bes Pelargic (although it might be a bit difficult or dangerous!). The MUD is in a state of constant development, and not all terrains are currently in the game, or in some cases, accessible to players. The terrains around existing towns, however, are accessible, with the exception of Genua and Bois. Terrains are usually populated with wildlife and can be interesting to explore! Some terrains can be dangerous, with extreme temperatures and sudden cliffs (cliffs can cause a player to fall and take heavy damage, and can be encountered around Lancre and towards The Hub).

While walking around the terrains, players can set their walk mode between walk and journey. Walking is the default movement mode and will move a character one room at a time, while journeying will allow a player to move several rooms at a time. Journeying on a road will follow the road in a certain direction, regardless of bends in the road, but stopping at intersections, while journeying off roads will move a player several rooms in the desired direction.


'''Syntaxes:'''
 journey {n|ne|e|se|s|sw|w|nw}
 walk {n|ne|e|se|s|sw|w|nw}
 options personal travel={walk|journey}

Using the options personal travel setting will allow a player to change the default movement mode (by default this is set to walk).


===Swimming===

If you find yourself in or on the surface of a river, lake, ocean or another body of water, you will automatically start to [[swim]] to stay afloat and to move between rooms. If you are very burdened and unskilled in [[swimming]] you will also sink to the bottom of the water, which makes it hard to breathe.

For more information, see [[Swimming]]


===Mounts===

You may purchase a [[mount]], such as a horse, which you can ride (among other uses).  They are quite expensive, and require a lot of upkeep, but provide access to a fast travel system irrespective of a player’s guild.

Unlike magical &amp; divine methods of travel, they are not ‘portals’ - they are more akin to the journey system of terrains, where you actually traverse the route albeit at great speed.  As such they are susceptible to failures during transit, which can leave you stopped at any point on the route.  This can be caused by the mount becoming exhausted (mounts have finite stamina, that regenerates slowly over time), being accosted by brigands, etc.

Similar to witches’ broomsticks, mounts can remember only a finite number of places (determined by their traits).  Furthermore, and uniquely, the routes themselves must be taught to the horse, in addition to the locations.  This is done by manually leading the horse through the desired route, from start to finish.  The mount can automatically stitch together multiple routes in sequence, in order to travel between two locations for which a direct route has not been trained (as long as the next route starts in the exact place the previous route finishes).

Mounts can also double as pack animals (with a potentially very high weight capacity, depending on traits) and combat aides.


===Travelling Shop===


There is a shop that appears and disappears in certain places in the disc, and, if someone is lucky enough to find it, can be used to travel between the shop's possible locations. The shop also has an array of rare and powerful items for sale.

For more information, see [[Travelling Shop]]


===L-Space===

On the disc, it is well known that books=knowledge=power=(force*distance^2)/time. It's therefore understandable that all libraries are connected by L-space.

L-space can be used by the resourceful, or the downright senseless, to travel between the libraries on the disc. Entrances and exits may be found in Ankh-Morpork, Djelibeybi, Sto-Lat, Bes Pelargic and Genua.

Entering a stationary gap will deposit you next to another gap, which you can use to transport yourself to another library.

Beware that wandering into L-space through the temporary distortions that replace normal exits will transport the player into an endless maze, which can take a very long time to escape from, predicting the exit point from L-space is downright impossible.

For more information, see [[L-space]].

===Godmother===

As a last resort, you can call for a fairy godmother to teleport you to your starting location. If you're a very new player, she'll help you out for free. If not, you will lose a life. If you're already dead, she will take a further life from you, teleport your corpse to your starting point, and revive you at your starting point.

If, however, you're stuck in a room with '''no''' exits (including hidden exits) due to a bug, she may transport you for free.

For more information, see [[Godmother]].


===Blue rings===

Twisting a [[blue crystal ring]] with at least one charge left by someone with enough skill in [[magic.items.worn.ring]] will teleport that person to a room somewhat recently visited by a player or a [[dangerous area]] like the [[Hub]]. This can get you away from some dangers, but possibly into other dangers.

=== Content from Unloading ===

When a room unloads, any items left in it will disappear, with a few exceptions:
*Items '''in or on furniture''' in a [[player house]] or [[player shop]] will remain (though items on the floor will still disappear)
*Items '''in the wardrobe''' of an [[Vault#Apex_Club_rooms|Apex Club rooms]], or in the drawer, hole, etc., of a vault, will remain (though, again, items on the floor will disappear).
*Items in [[newbie chest]]s will remain
*Items in the [[Gold_and_mahogany_ring|huge gold-bound chest]] will remain

Npcs in a room will also despawn when it unloads.  This can happen with [[pets]] as well.  Not to worry, though--they're not harmed by this, and will reappear the next time you log in.

Rooms seem to last varying amounts of time before unloading.

If you erect a [[tent]] in a room, it will stop the room from unloading for as long as the tent lasts.  Or, in other words, until the tent collapses or is collapsed, or until there is a reboot or crash.
