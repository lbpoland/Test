'''Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator''' (abbreviated as '''TPA''') is a first order defensive [[:Category:Wizard spells|spell]] which creates a magical impact shield around the caster.  

The barrier functions as a force field that will completely absorb most forms of damage until it is destroyed.

==Casting==
This spell costs 45 [[GP]] to cast and takes up 25 units of [[mind space]].

The following skills are used in the stages of this spell:
* [[Magic.methods.physical.evoking]]
* [[Magic.methods.elemental.air]]
* [[Magic.methods.physical.chanting]]
* [[Magic.methods.physical.enchanting]]
* [[Magic.methods.mental.channeling]]

===Components===
* A handful of fine white, grey or black [[ash]] (consumed)
* A shield (not consumed)

If the shield used is not a combat shield (i.e., one that cannot be used for [[blocking]]), the spell will be much weaker.  The lightest proper shield currently in the game is a [[ironwood buckler]]. If using a shield that cannot be used to block, the cast message will state that everything around you flashes a strange yellow, instead of the usual red.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell creates a [[:Category:Arcane shielding|magical shield]] which unconditionally absorbs almost all types of impact damage that strike it.

===Shield health and buffering===
This shield has two aspects associated with it
*The shield's ''total health'', which is the total damage it can absorb.
*The shield's ''buffer'', which is a proportion of the current total health.

The shield's total health degrades at a steady rate as time passes. It does not degrade when it absorbs damage.

The buffer fills up whenever the shield takes damage and, if filled past capacity, causes the shield to break.  While the shield is not taking damage, the buffer slowly empties.  The colour of the shield is an indication of how full the buffer is.  The shield colours are as follows, in increasing order of fullness of the buffer:

*Colourless/invisible.
*Dull red
*Bright red
*Wobbling orange.
*Flickering yellow.

As a practical example, at a high defensive bonus of around 600, a TPA can take approximately ~4,500 HP worth of damage on a freshly cast shield in a single rapid burst within a few seconds before breaking.  However, if left to recharge naturally back to "Invisible" between each hit before taking damage again, the shield can sustain a total of over ~40,000 HP worth before breaking in a single hit from invisible.  The time factor would also constantly be reducing the maximum strength of the shield during that period.  

===Defensive layering===
This shield is layered beneath the following:
*[[Endorphin's Floating Friend]]
*[[Grammer Scorbic's Household Guard]]
*[[Dodge]], [[parry]] and [[block]].

It is layered above:
*[[Armour]]
*[[Chrenedict's Corporeal Covering]].
*[[Heezlewurst's Elemental Buffer]] (probably, as fire weaponry isn't blocked by TPA after passing HEB).

==Component shield==

The '''[[ironwood buckler]]''' is now the lightest shield that can be used to give a full strength TPA.

==Notes==
*This spell is a more powerful version of [[Sorklin's Field of Protection]].  
*Re-casting while a current TPA is present but "Invisible" will result in a completely fresh TPA as if new - UNLESS the new cast would result in a weaker TPA, than the TPA currently in effect; basically, you cannot end up with a weaker TPA by re-casting, only the same or stronger (whichever will be strongest, remains).
*Re-casting while a current TPA is visible (dull red or worse) will only add a very small amount of strength back to the current shield, approximately 10%.
*This spell has superficial similarities with [[Mama Kolydina's Instant Infestation]], but differs in various important ways:
**[[Mama Kolydina's Instant Infestation]] does not use a buffer.
**Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator does not counterstrike against attackers.
**Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator is easier to stack than [[Mama Kolydina's Instant Infestation]].
*If Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator and [[Mama Kolydina's Instant Infestation]] are cast on the same person, then the latter shield will rapidly weaken the former until the former breaks.
*The "airy candy" from the [[Bes Pelargic L-space Bubble]] can be eaten to immediately end the current effects/duration of TPA.
*This spell cannot be cast on targets that have [[Minor Shield]] or [[Major Shield]] active.

''They said she had the Touch, although she just said that the best medicine for sheep or man was a dose of turpentine, a good cussin' and a kick. Bits of paper with Granny's own recipes for sheep cures stuck out all over the book. Mostly they involved turpentine, but some included cussin'.''

A [[mounts|horse remedy]] needs to be especially strong.

==Acquisition==
*Only witches can learn the treat command.
*Nanny teaches it to those who have enough of some skills. The following was enough to learn it:
**[[crafts.medicine.treatment.disease]] 30 levels (to be confirmed)
**[[magic.methods.mental.cursing]] 30 levels (to be confirmed)
**[[fighting.unarmed.striking]] 16 levels (to be confirmed)

&lt;pre>
You say: teach me please

Nanny Ogg nods.
Nanny Ogg says with a Lancrastian accent: 'Bout time you learned a new trick, luv.
Nanny Ogg whispers to you with a Lancrastian accent: I heard this one was invented by a sheep witch down on the Chalk, may she rest in peace.
Nanny Ogg looks solemn for a moment.
Nanny Ogg whispers to you with a Lancrastian accent: You'll be needing some supplies to use it, of course.  Smart gel like you will know where to find 'em.
Nanny Ogg nods knowingly at you.
Nanny Ogg loudly exclaims with a Lancrastian accent: Run along now an' give it a try!
&lt;/pre>

==Components==
You need [[turpentine]].

==Assess health (optional)==
Assessing the health of a [[mounts|rideable horse]] uses [[crafts.medicine.diagnosis]] (TM confirmed).

At 59-196 bonus, the health of a horse will seem to fluctuate between good and ill every time it is assessed, and there will be a note about the "untrained eye".

&lt;pre>assess horse health

The bay horse:
  To your untrained eye, he seems to be sick with some sort of horse illness.&lt;/pre>

Assessing a horse's health takes 25 GPs ''(to be confirmed)''.

==Treat==
To treat the horse you need to succeed in treating it in 3 different ways:

&lt;pre>syntax treat
Forms of syntax available for the command "treat":
treat &lt;living> with [a dose    
      of] turpentine from
      &lt;bottle>
treat &lt;living> with [a good]   
      cussing
treat &lt;living> with [a dose    
      of] turpentine
treat &lt;living> with [a] kick &lt;/pre>

*Treating a horse with turpentine requires crafts.medicine.treatment.disease ''(listed in helpfile)'' and takes 20 GPs  ''(to be confirmed)''.
**If you fail you don't use up the turpentine. Phew!
*Treating a horse with cussing requires magic.methods.mental.cursing ''(listed in helpfile)'' and takes 20 GPs  ''(to be confirmed)''.
*Treating a horse with a kick requires fighting.unarmed.striking ''(listed in helpfile)'' and takes 20 GPs  ''(to be confirmed)''.

Once you succeed the third treatment it's immediately cured!

====Failure====
Treating a horse with turpentine

&lt;pre>treat horse with a dose of turpentine from bottle

You try to administer a dose of turpentine from a large turquoise bottle to the bay horse in between opening and closing it, but he shies away, nose wrinkling.&lt;/pre>

Name
     treat - to cure animal diseases                                            

Syntax

Description
     Having nerves of steel and the willingness to give things a good      
     wallop are both required in the treatment of horses.  Interestingly   
     enough, these two traits are also essential to witchcraft.            
                                                                           
     This command allows you to cure horses or other player mounts of      
     disease through a three-pronged attack of medicine, headology, and    
     carefully managed violence.  You will need some turpentine and skill  
     in crafts.medicine.treatment.disease for the first, skill in          
     magic.methods.mental.cursing for the second, and skill in             
     fighting.unarmed.striking for the third.  The more severely diseased  
     the horse is, the more difficult it will be to treat it.              

Example
     >treat my horse with a dose of turpentine                                  
     You administer a dose of turpentine from a large red bottle to the red roan
     horse.                                                                     
     >treat my horse with a good cussing                                        
     You give the red roan horse a good cussin'.                                
     >treat my horse with a kick                                                
     You kick the red roan horse firmly but encouragingly.

'''Trip''' is a [[:Category:Fighting commands|fighting command]] which can be used to upset an opponent's balance during combat.

==Execution==
Although trip relies on unarmed skills, it may be performed whether holding a weapon or not.  In order to successfully trip an opponent, one must:
*Pass a [[fighting.special.unarmed]] test in order to prepare the attack.
*Succeed in a skillcheck of [[fighting.unarmed.grappling]] and [[dexterity]] against the opponent's appropriate [[fighting.defence]] skill (depending on their tactics response setting), [[strength]] and [[dexterity]].
**The skillchecks are also slightly adjusted by the relative weight of the attacker vs the defender, where the heavier of the two has an advantage.
**Having more free limbs provides an additional bonus.

==Effects==
The effects depend on the degree of success of the skillcheck:
*A high degree of success results in the victim being sent crashing to the ground, costing them a lot of [[action points]].  They remain at a substantial AP disadvantage until they get up again (which occurs automatically).  During this period, they cannot be tripped or [[shove]]d again.
*A lesser degree of success causes the victim to stumble, costing them a few [[action points]].
*Failure causes the ''attacker'' to stumble, costing ''them'' a few [[action points]].

Name
     trip - Knock someone's feet out from under them.                      

Syntax
     trip &lt;living>                                                         

Description
     This command allows you to trip your opponent up.  This does not      
     directly injure them (much) but does leave them vulnerable since they 
     must regain their feet and return to a fighting position.             
                                                                           
     The effects of tripping are subtle and may not be immediately obvious 
     but that does not mean they are not present.                          
                                                                           
     Your ability in fighting.special.unarmed determines your ability to   
     prepare this tactic, and your fighting.unarmed.grappling skill        
     combined with your dexterity determines the efficacy of your          
     manoeuvre.  Having extra free limbs also provides an additional bonus.
                                                                           
     Your opponent's defence skill as determined by their tactics response 
     setting; either fighting.defence.parrying, fighting.defence.blocking, 
     or fighting.defence.dodging; and their strength and dexterity         
     determine their ability to defend against your attack.  Additionally, 
     if your opponent is heavier than you are it will be harder for you to 
     trip them.                                                            
                                                                           
     It will cost you 30 fighting guild points to attempt to trip somebody.

Example
     > trip warrior                                                             
     You prepare to trip the warrior.

'''Value''' is a [[:Category:People commands|people]] [[Commands|command]] that determines the value of an item. It only works on jewellery, gems, weapons, armour and clothes.

{{-}}

==Messages==
Value returns various messages that give you an idea of how close you are to the real value.  From worst to best, they are :
*You're not very confident in your estimation.
*You feel pretty sure that your estimation is in the general region of the real value.
*You feel pretty confident that your estimation is close to the real value.
*You feel confident that your estimation is on the spot.

 |-

 |}

'''Vurdere''' is a command which can be used to gain an rough idea of how much good a piece of [[armour]] is at blocking damage.  It can also be used to compare two pieces of [[armour]] to see which is better.  It costs 25 GP to vurdere a single item, and 25 GP for each additional item when doing multiple comparisons, up to a maximum of 10 items.

Vurdere takes into account:
*The [[armour#Base armour class|base armour class]] of the armour.

Vurdere does not take into account:
*The degree of [[enchantment]] of the armour.
*The armour's condition.
*The armour's weight.
*Any of the player's skills.

When used to compare multiple pieces of armour, the accuracy of the command is dependent on the player's [[adventuring.evaluating.armour]] bonus.

==Reported quality==
The reported quality of the armour is dependent only on the armour's [[Armour#Base armour class|base AC]].  The vurdere command reports the quality separately versus the three physical damage types (blunt, sharp and pierce).

You can vurdere several items at once separately.
*For example: "vurdere armour 1 &amp; armour 2 &amp; armour 3"
*This uses 25 gp per item vurdered.
*There's no decrease in xp return with more items.
*The maximum amount of armours you can vurdere at once seems to be skill-dependent, 12 for a 222 bonus.

The following table indicates the base AC for each vurdere rating:

{|class="wikitable" border="1"
 !'''Base AC'''
 !'''Vurdere'''
 |-
 |0-3
 |Terrible
 |-
 |4-7

 |-
 |31-33
 |Extremely good
 |-
 |34+
 |Excellent
 |}

==Vurdere against==
You can vurdere an armour piece against another to get a rough idea of how different their AC is. This uses 50 adventuring gp.

First though (according to the mudlib) you need a good enough bonus to tell them apart.

Specifically, below a 350 bonus in [[adventuring.evaluating.armour|ad.ev.ar]], items that differ in absolute value less than the following will vurdere as "is the same as".
:smallest AC difference that you can vurdere = (350 - bonus) / 10

If you can tell the items apart you get one of the following message:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Message !!AC difference

'''Warcry''' is a [[:Category:Warrior commands|warrior-only command]] that is used to start combat. It costs 10 points to prepare it, and 10 more points when the cry is uttered.  

__TOC__
{{-}}
==Acquisition==
Warcry can be learned at 25 levels of [[fighting.special.tactics]] from a guild instructor or from another player who has the command.

== Syntax ==
 warcry &lt;message> 
 warcry random
 alias .warcries &lt;message>;&lt;message>;&lt;message>

==Effect==
If successful, it will temporarily lower the target's bonuses in their fighting skills.  There are a variety of messages that indicate how shaken the target is by your warcry; these may give an indication of how much their bonuses were lowered (if at all).{{Research}}

August 2010:  It will temporarily lower the target's bonuses in _all_ their skills, except points and ad.health.

June 2022: In a PK warcry situation, the target was so afraid they ran away: You are terrified by the intimidating bellow. Your feet run away with you! You become flustered!

It seems to be possible for a target to be affected by multiple warcries at once (from different warriors, naturally).

The target's [[fighting.special.tactics]] defends against it and can tm from it as well.

The warcry message may only be 100 characters long. Otherwise you get the message - You suddenly realise that your warcry, &lt;message>, is too lengthy to cow your foes.

'''Warpaint''' is a [[:Category:Warrior commands|warrior-only command]] used before or during combat. 

__TOC__
{{-}}
==Acquisition==
Warpaint can be learned at 25 levels of [[crafts.arts.painting]] from a guild instructor or from another player who has the command.

== Syntax ==

 warpaint &lt;warrior> {with|using} &lt;paint> drawing random                     
 warpaint &lt;warrior> {with|using} &lt;paint> drawing &lt;design>                  
 warpaint &lt;warrior> {with|using} &lt;paint> 
 warpaint remove [paint from] &lt;warrior> 
 alias .warpaints &lt;design>;&lt;design>;&lt;design>

==Effect==
A successful warpaint application will give your warcries a boost for as long as the paint lasts, as well as a minor boost to GP regeneration while in combat.

A successful application yields the messagee "The beast stirs within you, and you feel the urge to let loose a scream.", and it will make your warcry display this line right before firing: "A primal instinct adds extra weight to your cry.". If it fails the [[crafts.arts.painting]] skillcheck, you get the message "You feel a bit less fierce", and it will make you hesitate before warcrying (possibly affecting your warcry negatively).

The length of time an application will last can be determined from the adjective in the description line of a player wearing warpaint:

&lt;pre>Her face is [adjective] decorated with &lt;design> in &lt;colour> paint.&lt;/pre>

The adjectives and the time each lasts for are:
Fearsomely - 5mins+,
Vividly - 4mins,
Clearly - 3mins,
Decorated (no adjective) - 2mins,
Shakily (failure) - &lt;2mins.

The likelihood of gaining a more successful application scales with your [[crafts.arts.painting]] bonus, which caps out at consistent fearsome messages. The messages do not affect the boost given to gp or to warcry, with the possible exception of failure messages, the effects of which require further testing.

Lastly, while your warpaint is on and you are in combat, you regenerate an additional 3 gp every 4th [[heartbeat]], or +.75 gp/heartbeat.

==Notes==
You can warpaint [[warrior]] classed NPCs (warriors, old ladies, crows, watchmen, etc) for [[TM]]ing or just playing around. This includes almost every NPC who isn’t explicitly something else - included shearers, skeleton warriors and pets. 

It uses 20 craft [[gp]].

Any face covering, such as a mask or some helmets, will prevent you from painting your face and must be removed first. However, if you put on a mask or helmet after painting your face, the paint will still show through, like this:

&lt;pre>You can just make out &lt;design> in &lt;colour> paint beneath her mask.&lt;/pre>

It requires [[paint]].  A tin of paint (1 quart) has enough paint in it for fifty uses of the command.

You can fill a wearable [[liquid container]] like a blackened canteen with paint and paint yourself directly from it (it will automatically open and close the container in the process).

Sticks of camouflage paint are available from the [[Lancre Highland Regiment]] and the [[Hunters]] guild shops. You must hold the stick in order to warpaint with it. They weigh 1/9 lb. and come with 10 applications.

If you identify a container as your "component pouch" beforehand, you will automatically take out and use the first container of paint from it (also automatically opening and closing the paint container). However, you won't put it back in the component pouch automatically.

You can remove your own warpaint with the command syntax '''''warpaint remove me'''''. Removing warpaint costs no [[gp]].  Your face must be uncovered.  You cannot remove warpaint from NPCs.

You can mix two paint colours in a canteen and when you apply it will look like banded colours:

&lt;pre> Her face is vividly decorated with swirling dragons in bands of blush pink paint and desert brown paint.&lt;/pre>

More than two colours doesn’t work - the colour description becomes “unidentifiable gunge”.

Warpainting your [[horse]] increases its intuition and strength by 5.

=== Content from Weapons ===

{{Mudlib caveat|scope=page|status=unconfirmed}}

'''Weapons''' are, for almost all players, a necessity of every-day life on the Disc.  Players rely on their weapons to do physical damage to enemies and, if [[parry]]ing, to defend themselves.  There are a great variety of weapons on the Disc, suited to varying levels of proficiency and bloodthirstiness.

==General information==
Weapons are used in the Discworld MUD to (typically) kill things. Most are melee-oriented, but many are well suited to throwing. Certain weapons such as the crossbow and blowpipe are available in game but are of extremely limited use to non-[[Assassins]].

Weapons can be found in shops, or in the possession of players and NPCs. Certain weapons can only be acquired by completing [[Quests]]; those weapons are detailed here, but the means of getting them are not.

The [[Judge]] command can be used to assess the quality of a weapon ([[vurdere]] is used for [[armour]]). Note, however, that this command is only available after the player has 5 levels of the skill [[adventuring.evaluating.weapons]].

Some weapons can be used as melee as well as ranged weapons.

Any object can also be thrown at targets, but such objects are likely to be less effective than throwing weapons designed for such an attack.

==Weapon tables==

You can find tables with all individual weapons per type in the following pages:
{{Weapon tables}}

==Categories==
Weapons on the disc are divided into the following categories, each with its own skill associated with it.

Most weapons are '''melee weapons''', that can be used in close combat without using projectiles.

 |-

 |-
 |}

The type of a weapon can be seen by [[appraise|appraising]] it.

==Attacks==
Each weapon has one or more 'attacks' that may be used when a player strikes with it; each 'attack' has the following associated with it.
*The ''type of damage'' (blunt, sharp, piercing or fire) - this determines which variety of [[armour|armour class]] is used when the weapon strikes armour, and also determines which [[special attacks]] the weapon has associated with it. Fire damage ignores armour for the most part, taking several layers of it to make any difference. It may be that metal armour is treated differently than other types in regards to fire damage.{{research}}

*A ''difficulty rating'' - this determines how hard it is to perform that attack.
*A ''base damage'' characteristic - this is the distribution of damage caused by that attack, before any other modifiers (such as the player's skills) are applied.

For example, a long sword might have two attacks associated with it - slashing at someone and stabbing them with the point.  The former attack does slashing damage, and is easier than the latter to do.  The latter attack does piercing damage and, although harder to do, causes more damage.

It should be noted that although weapons may have multiple attacks associated with them, only one attack is used per strike - a weapon with 10 attacks does not strike any more often than one with a single attack.  Multiple attacks only serve to add variety to the weapon's damage, they do not make it hit any faster.

There is no way for a player to specifically view the attacks associated with a weapon, though the presence of multiple attacks could be inferred by observing the [[attack messages]] produced by the weapon over a while, thereby deducing the types of the attacks observed (eg. pierce and blunt). It should be kept in mind that there can be several attacks of the same type with different characteristics (average and maximum damage, chance to hit, etc.) produced by the same weapon.

==Special attacks==
Each weapon may have any number of [[special attack]]s associated with it; the list of special attacks is revealed on successful use of the [[judge]] command, but only for the special attacks known to the one using [[judge]].  Special attacks are attacks which require [[guild points]] to perform and consume additional [[action points]], but can cause much more damage than a normal attack would.

==Damaged weapons==
As weapons are used to attack or [[parry]], they become damaged and lose condition.  This negatively affects the damage that weapon can deal out, therefore it is important to keep weapons in good condition.  Weapons can be fixed in a location appropriate to the material they are made out of - metal weapons (most weapons are made of metal) are [[fix]]ed in a [[smithy]], leather ones (such as [[whip]]s) are [[leatherwork]]ed in a [[tannery]], and wooden weapons (staves and broomsticks) are [[repair]]ed in a [[woodworking shop]].

==Scabbards==
Due to their shape, many weapons do not fit well into standard containers (such as backpacks).  To that end, players can sheathe their weapons in [[scabbard]]s when they are not using them.

==Magical weapons==
Some weapons have [[magic]]al effects associated with them.  These can be divided into two categories:
*Weapons that serve a magical purpose, but don't automatically cause magical damage when fighting.  Examples include [[broomstick]]s and [[red staff|red staves]].
*Weapons that do (or have a chance to do) magical damage with each hit.  Examples include:
**[[Sarilak]] - sprays acid on striking.
**[[Ornate warhammer]] - poisons on striking.

==Mechanics - To hit==
The chance to hit an opponent with a weapon is a long and complex calculation.  In terms of factors ''directly affected by the attacker's weapon(s)'', the following sections apply.  Note that there are many other factors at play - for example, the opponent's [[dodge]] and/or [[parry]] prowess, how bright the room is, whether the attacker is low on [[guild points|fighting GP]], and so on.

===Attack selection and difficulty===
As indicated above, each weapon may have multiple attacks associated with it, and each attack has an an inherent difficulty rating.

When a player attempts an attack with a weapon, they are given a score as a random number.  This score is then modified as follows:
*It is increased by the attacker's [[strength]] stat.
*It is increased by the attacker's [[dexterity]] stat.
*It is decreased by 4.5x the weapon's weight (in lb).

The score is then compared against the difficulty rating for each attack.  Any attacks that have a higher difficulty rating&lt;ref>The distribution mudlib has this as lower difficulty rating (bug) - this has been confirmed as been fixed.&lt;/ref> than the score are discarded, and an attack is randomly chosen from the remainder.  If no attacks remain, then the attacker will fail to do anything for that combat round.

===Weapon encumberance===
The to-hit chance is affected negatively by the weapon's encumberance, that is, how hard it is to swing it around.  Specifically:
*There is a to-hit penalty proportional to the weapon's weight.
*If the player is holding multiple items, then there is a to-hit penalty based on the weight of the other held items.
**This penalty is reduced a lot if the item in question is a shield.
**This penalty is reduced if the player's [[Tactics#Response|tactics-response]] isn't parry - as long as the total weight of the other items is less than [[dexterity]]/9 lb.
*The weight penalty is decreased by 33% if the player is wielding the weapon in both hands.
*The weight penalty is reduced by an amount proportional to the player's [[strength]].

===Attacking with the off-hand===
If the attacker is attacking with a weapon held in their off-hand&lt;ref>To find out which hand your off-hand is, unhold everything and then hold a single-handed weapon.  Your off-hand is the hand you ''aren't'' holding your weapon in.  Note that, unusually, most players on the Disc are ''left-handed'', so your off-hand is probably your right.&lt;/ref>, then you need additional skill to wield it without penalty.  Specifically, you will incur a penalty if attacking with the off-hand and your dexterity is less than 14, with the penalty proportional to (14 - [[dexterity]]).

===Skills===
The attacker gets a to-hit bonus in proportion to the weapon skill appropriate to their weapon (see the ''categories'' section above).

==Mechanics - Action point cost==
The [[action points|action point]] cost of an attack determines, to a certain extent, how many attacks a player can make in a combat round.  The following sections detail how this cost is calculated.

===Weapon encumberance (round 2)===
Not only does weapon encumberance affect the chance to hit, but it also affects the AP cost of an attack - a more cumbersome weapon takes longer to attack with than a lighter one does.  Weapon encumberance has the following action point effects:
*The action point cost is increased by the 9x the square root of the weapon's weight (in lb).
*This cost is reduced by 33% if the weapon is held in both hands.
*If the attacker if wielding two weapons, then the action point cost is reduced by a small, constant amount (as you can use one to counterbalance the other).

===Skills===
The attacker's skills affect the action point cost as follows:
*The AP cost is reduced by an amount proportional to the attacker's bonus in the weapon skill appropriate to the weapon being used (see the ''categories'' section above).
*The AP cost is reduced by an amount proportional to the attacker's [[fighting.special.tactics]] bonus.

===Caps===
The action point cost for attacking has both maximum and minimum caps:
*It is capped at below 2x the 'base AP cost'
*It is capped at above 1/5 the 'base AP cost'

Therefore there are certain limits beyond which it is impossible to make a weapon attack any faster (or any slower).

==Mechanics - Damage==

===Base damage===
The damage calculation for a weapon starts with the weapon's ''base damage''.  This is essentially a representation of how good the weapon is on its own, before any other factors have been taken into account.

The base damage of a weapon may be categorized by a minimum, average and maximum damage caused by that weapon.  Weapons may fall into one of three categories as far as base damage is concerned:
*'''Constant damage''': These weapons always do exactly the same amount of base damage - thus, their minimum, average and maximum are the same.
*'''Flat variable damage''': These weapons may do anywhere between their minimum and maximum base damage, with an equal chance of a given hit being anywhere inbetween the two.
*'''Binomial variable damage''': These weapons may do anywhere between their minimum and maximum base damage, but a given hit is more likely to occur at a damage level around the average than towards the extremes.

You can derive a rough assessment of a weapon's average and maximum damage using the [[judge]] command.

===Why should I care about the maximum damage?===
Generally speaking, the average is the most important in terms of total damage dealt over time.  However, the maximum damage becomes relevant if you're attacking an armoured opponent, or one who otherwise has protection which removes a roughly constant amount from attacks.

The reason for this is hard to explain, but easy to demonstrate.  Essentially, a more variable weapon is more useful against armour because a lesser proportion of damage is removed from the 'big hits', and those have a bigger impact on the total damage dealt.

To illustrate this, consider the following example.  A target wearing armour is hit by two weapons, both with the same average damage:
*Weapon 1 does a constant 150hp damage per hit.
*Weapon 2 does between 50 and 250 damage per hit.

The armour absorbs 100hp from each strike.

Let us simulate 10 hits from weapon 1:

{|class="wikitable" border="1"

And now 10 hits from weapon 2:

 |0
 |70

 |50
 |130
 |140
 |130
 |10
 |40
 |'''570'''
 |}

As can be seen, the more variable weapon had the same total base damage before armour, but more of it got through.

While the above examples illustrate the point by assuming a constant amount of damage reduction, it should also be noted that past certain thesholds of damage dealt (relative to the AC of the location being damaged), AC is less effective. If the damage reduction in the examples had been entirely provided by AC, the actual total damage that would have gotten through in example 2 would have been 592 instead of 570.

===Enchantment and condition===
After the base damage has been determined, the effects of [[enchantment]] and condition are factored in as follows:

;Enchantment
Enchantment increases the damage caused by a weapon, via the following formula:

{{Prebox|Extra damage {{=}} base_damage * (%enchant)/(100 + %enchant)}}

So, a fully enchanted weapon will do 50% more damage; a 50% enchanted weapon will do 33% more damage.  Note that the absolute amount of enchantment in thaums on the weapon is irrelevant as far as damage goes - only the percentage of the maximum enchantment level for that item matters.

;Condition
A weapon does damage in proportion to its condition - so a heavily damaged weapon will do very little damage.  The following formula is applied:

{{Prebox|Damage {{=}} pre_condition_damage * (condition / max_condition)}}

So, a weapon that is at 50% condition will only do 50% damage, one at 25% condition does 25% damage, and so on.

===Effect of skills===
The weapon's damage is then combined with the relevant weapon bonus (as per the ''categories'' section above) in a ''geometric average'' to get the final weapon damage.  Specifically, the following formula applies:

{{Prebox|Total weapon damage {{=}} sqrt(damage * skill_bonus)}}

The total damage is capped at thrice the post-condition-and-enchantment damage; therefore insane skills for a puny weapon will not produce a particularly high damage.

Note that the consequence of the above formula is that increasing whichever is the ''lesser'' of the post-enchantment damage and the skill bonus has a bigger effect.  To illustrate this, consider two examples:

*In the first example, we have a novice player with a 100 sword bonus, wielding a 150 base damage unenchanted sword.  Their final average damage is 122.  If they were to fully enchant their sword (increase the post-enchant damage by 75), then their final average damage would be 150.  In order to get the same damage without enchanting their weapon, they would need to advance their sword skill until they had a bonus of 150 (increase bonus by 50).

*In the second example, we have a reasonably skilled player with 400 sword bonus, wielding a 150 base damage unenchanted sword.  Their final average damage is 245.  If they were to fully enchant their sword (increase the post-enchant damage by 75), then their final average damage would be 300.  In order to get the same damage without enchanting their weapon, they would have to advance their sword skill until they had a bonus of 600 (increase bonus by 200).

===Critical and marginal hits===
The damage can be further modified by the the degree to which the attacker won the earlier to-hit calculation:
*If the attacker succeeded their to-hit check by an extremely large margin, then their final damage is doubled.
*If the attacker succeeded their to-hit check by a very large margin, then their final damage is multiplied by 1.5.&lt;ref>As of {{Devblog|139 this announcement}}, though see also {{Devblog|144 this one}}.&lt;/ref>
*If the attacker only just succeeded in their to-hit check, then their final damage is halved.

===Damage inflicted===
So is the final damage, as determined above, that which ends up getting inflicted on the victim?  Not necessarily.  The figure as determined above is the total damage that is caused before any defensive considerations.  Thus, the actual amount of damage caused may be reduced by:
*[[Armour]].
*Defensive [[:Category:Spells|spells]] such as [[Chrenedict's Corporeal Covering]].
*Defensive [[:Category:Rituals|rituals]] such as [[Holy Aegis]].

==Descriptor Effects==
It is unknown if weapon descriptors (such as "blackened" or "blued") have any actual effect on the wielder's visibility.{{research}} This would be of particular interest to assassins and thieves, who would like to gain covert benefits from blackened or blued weapons.

There may also be other descriptors which may have other effects on game mechanics.{{research}}

On the other hand, is it also possible that descriptors have no direct effects beyond inspiring creators to match weapon characteristics with the item's name and description as they feel appropriate, which might lead to some variance in application.

=== Content from Weather ===

Weather can have several effects--it can affect your [[temperature]], the visibility and effectiveness of the [[map (command)|map]], make you [[wet]], or let you make [[snow]]balls and other things of snow.

There are several aspects to it.

==Type and severity of weather==
&lt;onlyinclude>&lt;includeonly>====Wind====&lt;/includeonly>&lt;noinclude>===Wind===&lt;/noinclude>
These are the messages you get in order from windless to as windy as you can get:
*no wind at all
*almost no wind
*a gentle breeze
*a steady breeze
*a strong breeze
*a steady wind
*gusty winds
*strong winds
*gale-force winds
*storm-force winds

&lt;includeonly>====Cloud cover====&lt;/includeonly>&lt;noinclude>===Cloud cover===&lt;/noinclude>
These are the messages you get in order from cloudless to as cloudy as you can get:
*a beautifully clear sky
*a few high level cirrus clouds
*scattered puffy clouds
*some puffy clouds
*many puffy clouds
*medium cloud cover
*dense cloud cover
*packed cloud cover
*thick black clouds
*thick heavy storm clouds
Looking at the clouds while outside gives you the room's full weather line.

&lt;includeonly>====Precipitation====&lt;/includeonly>&lt;noinclude>===Precipitation===&lt;/noinclude>
The precipitation part combines the following like so:
&lt;pre>
&lt;strength> &lt;type>
&lt;/pre>

Precipitation types depend on temperature, from coldest to warmest they are:
*snow
*sleet
*rain

Precipitation strength can be from the weakest to the strongest:
*light
*steady
*driving
*heavy
*very heavy (if rain: torrential)

You can look at the precipitation by type, i.e. look rain, but if it's sleeting you can only look at sleet not rain.

Doing so will give slightly different messages:
*lightly
*steadily (if there is a steady wind or stronger: hard)
*heavily
*very heavily (if rain: torrentially)

&lt;includeonly>====Storm====&lt;/includeonly>&lt;noinclude>===Storm===&lt;/noinclude>
With extreme rain and wind, you additionally see:
&lt;pre>
Peals of thunder and streaks of lightning rend the sky.
&lt;/pre>
Or if visibility is bad, you'll only see:
&lt;pre>
Peals of thunder echo overhead.
&lt;/pre>
&lt;/onlyinclude>

==Effects of precipitation==
If it's snowing, raining, or sleeting, visibility will be worse, meaning that the [[map (command)|map]] will be more limited than if the weather were clear.  The heavier the precipitation, the smaller the map gets--very heavy snow (for example) can make it impossible to see out of the room.

Being out in it make you [[wet]].

Being in a room where it is raining, sleeting, or snowing is a positive [[ritual modifier]] for [[Pishe|Pishites]].

====Making things from snow====
If it's snowing, or if you're in a room with snow on the ground such as the [[ice land]] (such rooms mention snow in the long description of the room), you can make things out of snow.

Most notably, you can make snowballs, which can then be thrown at others or yourself.

However, there's a wide range of other things you can make--these become temporary features in the room, remaining there until they melt (a process taking several minutes).

=== Content from Wet ===

Syntaxes:
 wet
 wet &lt;object>

"Wet" by itself tells you how wet you are, and how wet anything wet in your inventory is.  If neither you nor anything else in your inventory is wet, it will tell you that, instead.

"Wet &lt;object>" tells you how wet a particular thing or person is.

==Getting wet==
You can get wet by:
*Standing outside in rain, [[snow]], or sleet
*Splashing yourself or being splashed when it's raining
*Being [[temperature|hot]] and sweating
*Having a [[snow]]ball thrown at you
*Going into water
*Having [[Splash]] performed on you
*Having [[Soothing Rain]] performed in the room you're in
*Casting [[Mama Blackwing's Potent Preserver]] on a wet towel
*Failing [[Friddlefrod's Hydratic Extrusion]], sometimes

Towels get wet when you dry yourself with them, or if you have [[Splash]] performed on you when they're in your inventory.

==Getting dry==
You can get dry by:
*Drying yourself with a [[towel]] (the towel itself may not be too wet)
*Having [[Parch]] performed on you
*Casting [[Friddlefrod's Hydratic Extrusion]]
*Waiting, as you'll dry off over time

Towels can be dried with the "wring" command--the syntax "wring towel dry" will make you keep wringing them until they can't be wrung out anymore, but this takes longer than a single wring.  Pishites can also use a wet towel as a focus for [[Totem]], which dries it.

==Degrees of wetness==
For people:
*You are not wet.
*You look slightly wet.
*You look rather wet.
*You look wet and bedraggled.
*You are soaked and don't look that well at all.
*You look like you have just been dunked in a lake.

For objects:
*&lt;object> is not wet.
*&lt;object> is just barely damp.
*&lt;object> is slightly wet.
*&lt;object> is wet.
*&lt;object> is very wet.
*&lt;object> is sopping wet.
*&lt;object> is absolutely soaking wet.

==Effects of wetness==
Being wet gives you a [[description line|line in your description]] describing how wet you are.  It's the same as the output of the command (although with a different pronoun if someone else is looking at you).  You'll also see an occasional chat saying, simply, "Squelch".

There are some practical effects as well:
*Being wet cools you, but being wetter doesn't increase the cooling effect much. The cooling is helpful when you're feeling too warm, sweating helps in those situations.
*Getting wet will wash off/ruin some kinds of [[cosmetics|makeup and hairstyles]].
*The spell [[Mother Feelbright's Busy Bees]] does not work as well on wet people.

Towels can't be used to dry people for most of the "absolutely soaking wet" range, and can't be wrung out if they're only "slightly wet".

==Staying dry==
The following will keep you from getting wet from the rain:
*Casting [[Granny Lipintense's Layer of Lard]] (will also keep you from becoming any wetter when swimming or underwater)
*Wearing an amulet from the [[Ellamandyr's Hyaline Amulet]] spell
*Wearing a raincoat or most cloaks (some snow still seems to come through and make you a bit wet)

=== Content from Who ===

==Syntaxes and related commands==
&lt;code>who&lt;/code> by itself will give you a columned list of everyone who is online.

&lt;code>who verbose&lt;/code> will give you a list of everyone who is online, with their full names and titles.

&lt;code>who here&lt;/code> will give you a list of everyone who is in the room with you, with their full names and titles.

&lt;code>whois &lt;player>&lt;/code> will give you the full name and titles of one online player.

&lt;code>whoami&lt;/code> will give you your own full name and titles.

&lt;code>qwho&lt;/code> is similar to &lt;code>who&lt;/code>, but the output includes no titles of any kind or family names, and is formatted with a minimum of line breaks.  Creators, playtesters, [[friend]]s, and everyone else have separate sections.

&lt;code>who&lt;/code> and &lt;code>qwho&lt;/code> can optionally have filters applied to them to only give you a list of online players in particular groups.

===Filters===
To see who is online and in a given group, the syntax is &lt;code>who &lt;group>&lt;/code> (or &lt;code>qwho &lt;group>&lt;/code>--qwho works the same way).  So, for example, to see a list of online wizards, you would use &lt;code>who wizards&lt;/code>.

These are the groups that can be filtered for (may be incomplete):

Guild filters:
*Adventurer or adventurers
*Assassin or Assassins (includes all variations)
**Conlegium Sicariorum
**Ninja or ninjas
**Hashishim or hashishims
**Mano rossa
*Priest or priests
*Thief or thieves (includes all specializations--note that using the plural for the different specializations will give you members of the ''clubs'', not the specialization)
**Cutpurse
**Mugger
**Prowler
**Safecracker
**Smuggler
*Warrior or warriors (includes all variations)
**Ankh-Morpork Palace Guard
**Djelian Guard (?)
**Duchess Saturday's Musketeers
**Hublandish Barbarians
**Hunters
**Imperial Guard
**Klatchian Foreign Legion
**Lancre Highland Regiment
**Samurai
**Weapon Masters' Court
*Witch or witches
*Wizard or wizards (includes all specializations)
**'''Unseen University''':
&lt;!-- I can't find anything that filters for Student Wizard -->
**Undergraduate (Unseen University Undergraduate: before choosing a specialization)
**Circle (Ancient and Truly Original Sages of the Unbroken Circle)
**Star (Ancient and Truly Original Brothers of the Silver Star)
**Shadow (Sages of the Unknown Shadow)
**Hoodwinkers
**Lodgers (Mrs. Widgery's Lodgers)
**Seers (Venerable Council of Seers)
**Midnight (Order of Midnight)
**Last (Last Order)
**'''Hedge wizards''':
**White
**Blue
**Red
**Brown
**Green
**Black
**Grey
**Octarine
**'''Illusionary Institute of Learning''':
**Crescent (The Ancient Order of the Dynastic Crescent)
**Diviners? (Ancient Order of Djinn Diviners)
**Scarab (Ancient Order of the Scintillating Scarab)

Other filters
*Clubs: You can use the name of a [[club]] as a filter, filtering for people who belong to that club.
*Creators
*Dead: Filters for dead people.
*Family or families: Filters for people who are in families.  You can also use a specific family name as a filter.
*[[Friend]]s: People on your friends list
*Gods: Using the name of a god ([[Pishe]], [[Gufnork]], [[Gapp]], [[Sandelfon]], [[Fish]], [[Hat]], [[Sek]]) as a filter will filter for priests and followers of that god.
*[[Agatean family]]: Using the name of an agatean family ([[Fang]], [[Hong]], [[McSweeney]], [[Sung]], [[Tang]]) as a filter will filter for players who are part of that agatean family.
*Helpers
*[[Playerkillers|Killers]]
*Liaisons
*Magistrate or magistrates
*Nationality: You can filter by nationality.  Nationalities are Agatean, Djelian, Genuan, Klatchian, Lancrastian, Morporkian, and Uberwaldean.
*Newbie
*Playtester or playtesters
*Roleplayers: Players who have used the [[roleplaying (command)|roleplaying command]] to set a [[roleplaying]] location will show up in the "roleplayers" filter.

You can make more complex filters by using ampersands (&amp;), commas (,) and minus signs (-).  If you specify multiple groups, you need to have either an ampersand or a comma separating them; otherwise they get treated as one group and the filter will not work as intended.

An ampersand works as a Boolean AND. If you put it between groups, it will filter for people who are members of ''every'' group at the same time.  So, for example, &lt;code>who priests &amp; sek&lt;/code> will return Sekkite priests, but not Sekkite followers or priests of other gods.

A comma works as a Boolean OR. If you put it between groups, it will filter for people who are members of ''any'' group specified.  So, for example, &lt;code>who witches, wizards&lt;/code> will give you a list of witches and wizards.

A minus sign works as a Boolean NOT. If you put it in front of a group, it will exclude members of that group.  So, for example, &lt;code>who priests &amp; -sek&lt;/code> will give you a list of priests of gods other than Sek.  Meanwhile, &lt;code>who priests, -sek&lt;/code> will give you a list of people who are either a priest, ''or'' not a Sekkite (in other words, it returns everyone who is online ''except'' Sekkite followers (but it doesn't exclude Sekkite priests)).

==Verbose output==
Someone's full whois (what shows up in who verbose, a filtered who, whois, or their reference) has several parts.

[Pre-title] &lt;Name> ["nickname"] [Family name] [(AFK: &lt;afk message>)] [(&lt;creatorhood>)] &lt;guild title>, [custom title], [Lord/Lady of Darkness/Light], [Blackheart], [Member of the Apex Club], [Reporter for the &lt;newspaper>], [Priesthood title], [Agatean Family Title], [{a member{{!}}the leader} of &lt;group>] [(Playtester)] [(Idle: &lt;number>)]

Name and guild title are always present.

===Pre-title===
This is the title, if any, which they have set with the [[title]] command.

===Name===
This is the player's name--what they use to log in.  This is always present.

===Nickname===
The Mano Rossa have access to special nicknames.

===Family name===
If the player belongs to a [[family]], their family name is next.

===Afk===
If they are [[afk]], their afk message is shown here, as "(AKF: &lt;message>)".

===Creatorhood===
If they are a creator, this is indicated here in parentheses.

===Guild post-title===
Next comes another title indicating guild, specialization (if applicable) and approximate guild level or rank.  If the player is part of a guild's political structure, this is indicated in place of guild level or rank.  For the most part, this is automatic; however, the "[[guildtitle]]" command is learnable for some guilds (guild level 450 for priests and warriors; 425 for thieves) and can be used to set it to a previous title or combination of titles.

This is always present.

*All witches are "the Witch", as witches have no explicit ranking.
*Wizards are either, "the &lt;student title>", "the &lt;Rank> Level Wizard", "of the &lt;Order>, the &lt;Rank> Level Wizard", "the Senior Wizard of the &lt;Order>", or "the &lt;Colour>" (for Hedge wizards).

===Custom title===
If a player has set a custom title with a [[title changer]], it will be added here.

===Lord or Lady or Creature of Light or Darkness===
"Lord/Lady/Creature of Light" (depending on gender) is a special title automatically given to the most good-[[alignment|aligned]] person online.  Likewise, the "Lord/Lady/Creature of Darkness" title is given to the most evil-aligned person online.

===Blackheart===
The "Blackheart" title comes from having touched the blade of a [[Sarilak]] while sufficiently evil since having logged on.

===Member of the Apex Club===
If a player is a member of the [[Apex Club]] and currently wearing their Apex Club badge, "Member of the Apex Club" goes here.

===Reporter for the AM Daily or Green Slab===
If a player is a reporter for a [[newspaper]] and wearing that paper's press credentials, this will go here.  If you're wearing two sets of press credentials, only the one you most recently wore will give you the title.

===Ramtops Rambler===
If a player is a Rambler, then "Ramtops Rambler" goes here.

===Ankh-Morpork City Architect===
If a player is an Architect, then "Ankh-Morpork City Architect" goes here.

===Agatean family title===
If a player is a member of an [[Agatean family]] and currently wearing their family crest, they'll get a title here indicating the family they're part of and their rank within the family.

===Priesthood title===
If a player has a special role in a priesthood apart from High Priest or High Priestess, this shows up here.  These include various Minister titles, PR Representatives, and presumably Secretaries to High Priest(esse)s.

===Quest title===
Each [[quest]] comes with a title.  You can choose one with "title quest", remove it altogether with "title quest none", or let it be random with "title quest random" (which is the default).

===Group===
If someone is [[group]]ed, the group they're a member or the leader of is shown here.

===Playtester===
If someone is a playtester, they get "(Playtester)" here.

===Idle===
Finally, if someone has been [[idle]] for two minutes or more, the number of minutes they've been idle is indicated in parentheses here.

=== Content from Wildswing ===

{{Infobox command
 | gp=15 to prepare, and an extra 20 per target
 | learntat=40 [[fighting.special.weapon]] and enough uses of the [[berserk]] command
 | skills=[[Fighting.special.weapon]] and [[fighting.melee]] for the weapon used
 | items=A two-handed sharp or blunt [[weapon]]
 | guild=[[Warriors Guild|Warriors]]
}}

'''Wildswing''' is a [[:Category:Warrior commands|warrior-only command]] used during combat that will launch an attack on two or more opponents at once. It is gained at 40 levels in [[fighting.special.weapon]] and after [[berserk|berserking]] a total of 20 times (if you've already berserked 20 times before the introduction of the command, the command is gained upon the next berserk).

If successful, the warrior will launch a powerful attack on multiple opponents during a round. Number of targets attempted to hit depends on the warrior's fi.sp.we ability, and is capped at a maximum of 5. The efficacy of attacks depends on [[fighting.melee|fi.me]] for the weapon.

If one of your swings is succesfully blocked by a shield-bearing opponent, the wildswing may be completely disrupted, causing you to lose all the following swings.

Wildswing can only be used with two-handed weapons which are at least 1/5 sharp or blunt.  This means that unless you have nonstandard arms, you can do this to simplify the command:

alias wildswing wildswing with left weapon

Since  a two-handed weapon will always occupy your left hand unless you have been enchanted by the right spell(s), this suffices and lets you change weapons freely.

=== Content from Wimpy ===

==Setting the wimpy level==
A player can set their wimpy level either by using the 'wimpy' command, or through 'options combat'.

The wimpy level can be set anywhere between 0% and 30%, and is displayed in the [[score]] command.  If wimpy is set to zero, then this is displayed as being 'in brave mode'.

==Operation==
Whenever a player is hit and their current hitpoints are below the wimpy proportion, they will immediately and automatically attempt to leave the room.  This has advantages and disadvantages.

===Advantages===
*Wimpying temporarily puts the player out of harm's way, potentially allowing them to escape and recover if they take further action.
*In periods of heavy lag, an automatic wimpy may allow a player to escape from peril whilst they are unable to manually intervene with any surety.

===Disadvantages===
*Wimpy can be disorienting, as it causes a sudden and unexpected change of location; thus, it can sometimes be worse than a less timely, but better planned retreat.
*Almost all NPCs will follow players who leave the room within a couple of seconds, thus the reprieve is temporary at best.
*Some NPCs or players may [[pursue]], in which case wimpy will not remove the player from danger.
*Wimpying may be fatal in and of itself if the exits are [[trap]]ped, enemies are waiting in [[ambush]], or the exit taken is off of a sheer drop.
*If you wimpy into a room with aggressive npcs, you can end up wimpying back and forth between the two rooms, making it more difficult to run away properly (as opposed to accidentally fleeing to the room you just left).
*Awarded kill [[XP]] is scaled down in proportion to the victor's wimpy  level (so a wimpy of 10% results in 90% of the kill XP being awarded, for example).
*Wimpying interrupts [[rituals]], potentially stopping you from passaging away, etc., at a vital moment.
*Wimpy ends your combat when you flee, but does not affect those who are fighting you. A PK who is in combat with a mix of PKs and NPCs will die a real death if they wimpy from a PK and are then killed by an NPC. A player of over a year's experience gained in a 7 year period died their last death after running from an aggressive NPC, then taking unintended PK area effect spell damage which caused him to wimpy back to that NPC.

==Forcing and preventing wimpy==
Targets can be forced to wimpy (irrespective of their actual wimpy level) by:
*Performing the [[Fear]], [[Horror]], or [[Terror]] rituals on them.
*(If outside) Performing the [[Agoraphobia]] ritual on them.
*(If in combat) Allegedly, performing the [[Demoralise]] ritual on them.
*Casting [[Sorsalsean's Seismic Eruption]] on the room they are in. 
*Intoxicating them.

Targets can be prevented from wimpying by:
*A [[warrior]] [[guard]]ing exits against them.
*A witch casting [[vines]] on them.
*Casting [[Myrandil's Vicious Seizure]] on the room they are in.

A failure to pull something from a [[black top hat]] can result in a feeling of paranoia which causes occasional wimpying.

==Skill relationships==

*Wisdom features strongly in the [[Skills - Faith|faith]] skill tree, affecting all skills there.
*It plays a significant role in the [[Skills - Magic|magic]] and [[Skills - People|people]] skill trees.
*It is not used very much in the [[Skills - Crafts|crafts]], [[Skills - Covert|covert]], [[Skills - Fighting|fighting]] or [[Skills - Adventuring|adventuring]] skill trees, although the important [[adventuring.perception]] skill is a notable exception.

==Guild reliance==

*[[Priests]] usually have very high levels of wisdom, as it strongly affects most faith skills.
*[[Witches]] and [[wizards]] may have minor levels of wisdom to augment various magical skills.
*[[NPK]] [[thieves]], [[assassins]] and [[warriors]] generally have little use for wisdom.
*[[Playerkillers]] may have significant levels of wisdom to improve their [[adventuring.perception]] skill.
