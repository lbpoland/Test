=== Content from Bright ===
The '''bright''' command tells you how much light people or objects emit.  Used by itself, it tells you the ambient light level.

You can also use it to check surrounding rooms with: "bright exit &lt;exit name>" or compare the illumination of several items with "bright &lt;object> against &lt;object(s)>".

__TOC__

==Sight modifiers==
Brightness is subjective: performing [[Dark Sight]] causes the command to show rooms as being brighter than normal.

Wearing a [[bronze helm]] doesn't change the apparent brightness, but it does make you more light sensitive.  While wearing it, you become effectively blind somewhere in the "very brightly lit" range instead of the "too brightly lit to see clearly" range.

Wearing [[dwarfish goggles]] prevents you from being blinded when you would otherwise be unable to see because it is too bright, but it also reduces your perception.

Having a higher [[adventuring.perception]] allows you to see in darker areas.{{research}}

==Ambient light==
{{Mudlib caveat|scope=section|status=unconfirmed}}

Information from the mudlib shows that the suggested light levels are the following:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Description !!Light level
|-
|Magically darkened room ||&lt; 0
|-
|Absolutely dark room ||0
|-
|Standard dark room ||5
|-
|Dimly lit room ||20
|-
|Mine shaft with candles ||30
|-
|Partially lit room ||50
|-
|Well lit room ||60
|-
|Shaded forest ||60
|-
|Brightly lit room ||80
|-
|Direct Sunlight ||100
|-
|Explosion or flash ||200+
|}

The different races are supposed to have the following light ranges, but this is not implemented in the mudlib.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Description !!Light level range
|-
|Human ||50-300
|-
|Elf ||5-200
|-
|Dwarf ||5-200
|-
|Troll ||5-100
|-
|Gnome ||5-150
|}

Instead, the mudlib defines thresholds based on humans used for everyone, since all players are human:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Description ||Thresholds limit ||Variable name
|-
|in pitch darkness ||&lt; 10 ||THRESHOLDS[ 0 ]
|-
|in near darkness ||&lt; 30 ||THRESHOLDS[ 1 ]
|-
|too bright to see clearly ||> 200 ||THRESHOLDS[ 2 ]
|-
|too bright to see ||> 300 ||THRESHOLDS[ 3 ]
|}

The ambient light levels are defined as follows in the code to bright:
{| class="wikitable"
!Normalized range !!Range for humans !!Message !!Comment
|-
|&lt; 0 ||&lt; 0 ||in the darkness that lies beyond darkness. ||Negative lighting!
|-
|&lt; THRESHOLDS[ 0 ] ||0 - 9 ||in pitch darkness ||Much harder to see.
|-
|&lt; THRESHOLDS[ 1 ] ||10 - 29 ||in near darkness ||Harder to see.
|-
|0 - 5 ||30 - 40 ||very poorly lit ||
|-
|6 - 10 ||41 - 48 ||poorly lit ||
|-
|11 - 20 ||49 - 65 ||dimly lit ||
|-
|21 - 30 ||66 - 82 ||quite well lit ||
|-
|31 - 40 ||83 - 99 ||well lit ||
|-
|41 - 50 ||100 - 116 ||brightly lit ||
|-
|51 - 100 ||117 - 200 ||very brightly lit ||
|-
|> THRESHOLDS[ 2 ] ||201 - 300 ||too brightly lit to see clearly ||Harder to see.
|-
|> THRESHOLDS[ 3 ] ||> 300 ||too brightly lit to see ||Much harder to see.
|}
The output of [[bright]] normally starts with the short name of the room (as in glance):
:&lt;Room's short name> is 
If the light is not bright enough (below 10 or between 10 and 29 to a lesser degree) to recognize the room instead it starts with:
:Wherever you are, it's 
If the light is too bright (above 300 or between 201 and 300 to a lesser degree) to recognize the room instead it starts with:
:Something is

==Yourself and objects==
{{Mudlib caveat|scope=section|status=unconfirmed}}

The amount of light you emit depends on the [[:Category:Light sources|light sources]] you're carrying, and whether you're under the effects of the [[Light]] ritual.

The levels of illumination are:
{| class="wikitable"
!Normalized range !!Range for humans !!Message
|-
|&lt; 0 ||&lt; 0 ||&lt;are/is> dark beyond darkness.
|-
|0 ||0 ||produce&lt;nowiki>&lt;s>&lt;/nowiki> no light at all.
|-
|&lt; THRESHOLDS[ 0 ] ||1 - 9 ||produce&lt;nowiki>&lt;s>&lt;/nowiki> a faint light.
|-
|&lt; THRESHOLDS[ 1 ] ||10 - 29 ||produce&lt;nowiki>&lt;s>&lt;/nowiki> a bit of light.
|-
|0 - 24 ||30 - 72 ||produce&lt;nowiki>&lt;s>&lt;/nowiki> quite a bit of light.
|-
|25 - 49 ||73 - 114 ||&lt;are/is> very bright.
|-
|50 - 100 ||115 - 200 ||&lt;are/is> extremely bright.
|-
|> THRESHOLDS[ 2 ] ||201 - 300 ||&lt;are/is> so bright it hurts to look.
|-
|> THRESHOLDS[ 3 ] ||> 300 ||&lt;are/is> so bright you can't bear to look.
|}

==Balsa wands==
{{Main|Balsa wand}}
Balsa wands can be used to make any item a permanent source of light, unless the item is destroyed or otherwise changed in a way that makes this effect lost. Using stable items is recommended, or at least test the change after one zap to see if it remains.

Each successful zap adds some light to the object, enough so that five successful zaps without any failure in between make the item produce quite a bit of light.

If at any time a balsa wand is zapped at an item but the player fails the skillcheck, then some of the light that the item produces is removed. The amount of light can never go below zero (no darklights).

[[Category:Innate commands]][[Category:Concepts]]

=== Content from Condition ===

==Using the command==
There are several available syntaxes:
 condition &lt;item(s)> damaged sorting {up|down} 
 condition &lt;item(s)> sorting {up|down} 
 condition &lt;item(s)> damaged 
 condition &lt;item(s)>

The "damaged" argument will cause it to ignore items in excellent condition.

Note that you can use "damaged" as an adjective for other commands; i.e., "[[fix]] damaged weapon" or "locate damaged things". Using the adjective damaged will find items that condition damaged will not find, those items that have excellent condition but are not at 100 % of their total condition.

Adding "sorting up" will cause it to list the items from most damaged to least damaged, while adding "sorting down" will cause it to list them from least damaged to most damaged.

==Condition stages==
{| class="wikitable"
! % of &lt;br>total &lt;br>condition !!Item is &lt;condition>
|-
| 91 - 100 || in excellent condition.
|-
| 81 - 90 || in very good condition.
|-
| 71 - 80 || in good condition.
|-
| 61 - 70 || in decent condition.
|-
| 51 - 60 || in fairly good condition.
|-
| 41 - 50 || in fairly poor condition.
|-
| 31 - 40 || in poor condition.
|-
| 21 - 30 || in really poor condition.
|-
| 11 - 20 || in very poor condition.
|-
| 1 - 10 || in atrocious condition.
|-
| &lt; 1 || a complete wreck.
|}

Some items have no condition.

==Changing condition==
*Weapons get damaged when you fight with them.
*Armour gets damaged when you're hit on the part of the body it covers.
*Clothing gets damaged when you're hit on the part of the body it covers by slash or pierce damage, but not blunt damage. This includes [[containers]] that cover an area of the body.
*[[Floaters]] get damaged when blocking damage to the caster.
*Jewellery gets damaged (sometimes) when you cast [[Jogloran's Portal of Cheaper Travel]] on it.
*A failure of [[Gryntard's Feathery Reliever]] can damage the item.
*Failing a step during [[finesmithing]] will also damage the item you're working on.
*Polishing an engraving to remove it from an item damages it a bit.

If something is damaged too much, it will break (disappear completely) and be permanently lost (if a container breaks this way, the contents will spill out into your inventory or on the ground).

You can improve an item's condition with the following means:
{| class="wikitable"
!Method !!Objects that can be repaired
|-
|[[Fix]] in a [[smithy]] or a [[thieves' guild]] launder room ||weapons and metal worn items, stone shields
|-
|[[Repair]] in a [[woodworking shop]] or a [[thieves' guild]] launder room ||Wooden things
|-
|[[Leatherwork]] in a [[tannery]] or a [[thieves' guild]] launder room ||Leather things
|-
|[[Sew]] with a sewing needle and sinew thread ||Leather things
|-
|[[Sew]] with a sewing needle and cloth thread ||Cloth things
|-
|Place on [[Gapp's low altar]] ||Clothes (cloth or leather)
|-
|[[Mend]] ritual from [[Gapp]] ||Cloth things
|-
|[[Mending npcs]] ||Clothes, jewellery, maybe others
|}

Improving an item's condition through these means slightly reduces its maximum [[value]]. This means it will cost less to repair in the future, but sell for less to a general store or fence. Fortunately, this has no effect on the durability of a [[blorple]]. 

You can directly [[locate]] most of these types of items in your inventory except for metal where you need to locate steel, locate iron, etc.

You can improve clothing's condition by putting it on the low altar of [[Gapp]] in [[Ankh-Morpork]]--this takes faith gp, and the more gp is spent, the more the item will be repaired.{{research}} (Leather items usually can't be improved this way, and will just fall off the altar with no result.)

[[Fix]] used to work on all weapons because woodworking areas were too few, this seems to have been changed back so that fix only works on metal items.

==Material==
Objects have different characteristics based on their material. Appraise returns the material(s) of the item, many items have several materials.
{{Mudlib caveat|scope=section|status=unconfirmed}}
The condition of items are based on their weight and the material they are made of. Some materials like cloth seems to have extremely high condition values, but they are so much lighter that this is not as extreme as it looks. In the following table the condition values are multiplied by the weigh modifiers to help show this. Actual formulas used could be wildly different from this.
{| class="wikitable sortable"
