Combat
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Combat--the fine art of killing things--is the most common way to gain
   experience, items, and money on the Discworld. In its most basic form,
   combat is pretty simple--you pick up a weapon, find an NPC, and hit
   them with it. Unfortunately, this "basic system" is likely to get you
   killed.

The Basics
   The first thing a new player should know about fighting is that you
   Pick On Things Your Own Size. A new character can find decent weapons
   and armour, but still has practically zero skills. He's not going to be
   able to fight even a child with a guarantee of success; larger things
   will likely squash him outright.
   This is where the consider command comes in. It measures your
   strength-- based on your held weapons, worn armour, and hit points--and
   compares it to your target. A new player will find that he is roughly
   as strong as squirrels, rats and cockroaches.
   Advancing your fighting skills will let you fight tougher foes
   successfully. For melee-friendly classes, like warriors, assassins,
   and, to a lesser extent, thieves, can be done relatively easily; you
   simply find an NPC trainer and advance your combat-related skills, as
   explained in Introduction to Skills. It's important to advance the
   skills you actually use; fighting.melee.dagger only helps when you're
   holding a dagger.
Syntax
   To start fighting something, there are two syntaxes you can use:
kill <living>
attack <living>
   You can use either one with multiple targets; e.g., "kill bodyguards",
   "kill all" (not recommended), "kill all except pets", etc.
   To stop fighting something, you can "stop fighting". This has somewhat
   limited use, since it does not stop things from fighting you (they will
   still attack you if you go back into the room with them).
   The command "score fighting" will tell you whether you are currently in
   combat with anything.
More HP for Me
   You start off with 500 hp, or hit points. That's dangerously low.
   You lose hp when successfully attacked and you will die when you lose
   all of your hp. Attacks that do hundreds of hit points in one hit are
   VERY common.
   Once you join a guild, you can advance adventuring.health to 25 in the
   guild. This will boost your maximum hp to roughly 1300. You'll want
   more hp later but, for now, the extra 800 hit points will provide you a
   much needed safety buffer.
Physical Weapons
   While some players opt to engage in physical combat with their hands
   and feet, the vast majority prefer the use of martial (or,
   occasionally, marital) weapons.
   Lighter weapons tend to be faster, but do less damage; the opposite is
   also true for their heavy counterparts. The real factor affecting a
   weapon's effectiveness, though, is the player holding it. A warrior
   with a 500 bonus in fighting.melee.dagger will be more effective with a
   dull butterknife than a brand-new player struggling to hold a Holy
   Blade of Soyin. Don't try to find the BESTEST WEAPON EVARR until you're
   more experienced; for now, choose a weapon you seem comfortable with.
Armour
   Armour, unlike weapons, does not rely on a player's skill to perform
   its function. A level 300 warrior wearing a steel breastplate is just
   as protected as a newbie wearing the same equipment.
   The most important things to remember about armour, as a newbie, are:
     * Protect your vitals. On Discworld, this means primarily your neck,
       head, and chest (in that order).
     * Watch your burden. Some armour is good; too much, however, can be
       disastrous. Acceptable burden for a dodge user is roughly 10-15
       percent; a parry-based player can often get away with as much as
       35% burden. In any case, don't let your burden climb past 50%; at
       that point, your abilities will start to be crippled by the weight.
     * This isn't Dungeons and Dragons. All guilds are allowed to wear
       armour, so feel free to put on a breastplate, even if you're a
       wizard.
Magic and Faith
   The magic and faith-based classes may also advance their combat skills
   at their trainers, though to a much more limited extent. Their real
   strength lies, of course, in their own Guild's areas of expertise. For
   example:
   Priests have, depending on their chosen god, access to a variety of
   helpful rituals. All Gods grant the Totem ritual, which summons a small
   supernatural being to the Priest's side. This being will throw itself
   in the way of most oncoming attacks, until it dies. While the Totem
   creature will attack foes, its offensive ability is severely limited.
   The totem's strength may be increased, however, by advancing the skill,
   faith.rituals.miscellaneous.target.
   Rituals like these do not (usually) change a Priest's physical
   strength; nor will Spells normally alter the physical power of a Wizard
   or Witch. Nevertheless, these powers will greatly increase an arcane
   player's ability to defend him (or her) self and inflict mortal injury
   upon those foolish enough to harass them.
   Like more direct combat-based methods, spells and rituals may be
   strengthened by advancing the relevant skills.
AP or R.I.P.
   Everyone in combat needs action points to make attacks or defend
   against attacks. The MUD will never display the action points but you
   can see the results.
   For a newbie, the most important parts are:
     * Every time you do an action in combat: attack, dodge, parry, stand
       up after being tripped, etc., you spend Action Points.
     * If you are too busy defending, you will rarely, if ever attack.
       When greatly outnumbered, you won't even be able to try to defend
       against all of the attacks. This can make fighting multiple
       opponents a fatal situation.
          + Don't "kill all" as a newbie. You don't want to be
            outnumbered.
          + Be careful when an NPC is in a room with potential allies. One
            little old lady may seem killable. She'll be a much tougher
            foe once her friends join the fight.
     * Overwhelming a foe with attacks can work in your advantage.
          + Group with friends and you can outnumber the NPCs.
          + Some spells and rituals create NPCs that fight with you. A
            priest can outnumber foes using summoned allies.
          + Picking a faster weapon, like daggers, can reduce the number
            of attacks a weak target makes--they'll be busy dodging your
            attacks.
     * You can increase your speed in combat by advancing
          + fighting.special.tactics
          + the relevant fighting.defense.* skill(s)
          + the relevant fighting.melee.* skill(s)
Know when to run
   If you're in a fight and taking the worst of it, run. The more hurt you
   are, the worse you are at combat--so get out of there before you die!
   Many NPCs will try to follow you somewhat. Moving two rooms has a
   decent chance of losing them. More distance is better, as NPCs may
   wander around. If they wander into your room while they're still upset
   with you, they'll attack you on sight.
   (Some NPCs are much more aggressive at chasing and can use pursue.
   These NPCs tend to be much too tough for newbies to fight.)
     * Tricky npcs to stay away from them or if looking for a challenge
       that might end with Death having a little chat with you.

   eight branches.

Skill System
Trees and branches
   Discworld uses a skill system, which is divided into eight skilltrees:
   Adventuring (skill tree)
   Covert (skill tree)
   Crafts (skill tree)
   Faith (skill tree)
   Fighting (skill tree)
   Magic (skill tree)
   People (skill tree)
   Languages
   A tree can branch into subskills and sub-subskills.
   What you actually use is the bonus, not the level. But to increase your
   bonus you need to increase your level or change your stats, which can
   be done temporarily with stat effects.
   To refer to a skill you have to provide the path to it, for example
   fighting.defence.dodging.
     * You can abbreviate skills by only listing a few letters: skills
       fi.de.do.
     * Note that if two skills could be referred by such reduced version
       the mud will use one, but this might not be the one you want. For
       example, ma.me.me.ch is channeling, not charming, so you'd have to
       use skills ma.me.me.char instead.
   Languages are special, you start with one and need to learn others from
   specific teachers before you can improve them. They do not use stats.
Calculation of levels
   The level of the skilltree is calculated by taking the average of the
   levels of the main branches and rounding this down to the nearest
   integer. On its turn, the level of a (sub) branch is calculated the
   same way, by taking the average of the levels of the sub (sub) branches
   and rounding this down to the nearest integer.
Calculation of guild level
   A player's guild level is not the skilltree level of his specialisation
   (shown by 'skills primaries'). The guild level is calculated by taking
   the average of the level of the outermost branches and round this down
   to the nearest integer. For a wizard, the outermost branches are e.g.
   magic.methods.mental.animating and magic.methods.mental.channeling, not
   magic.methods.mental nor magic.methods.
Improving your skills
   There are 4 methods of improving your level, and hence your bonus, in a
   skill.
The Taskmaster
   To gain levels from the taskmaster you don't need to do anything, just
   using skills has a chance to advance your skills!
     * The taskmaster is the system that performs skill checks on
       Discworld. It decides if you pass or fail a skill check, the degree
       to which you do so, and whether you are to be awarded a skill
       increase as part of your attempts.
     * To TM is to gain a level from the taskmaster.
     * It is often said that you have the most chance to get a TM when you
       have 50% chance to pass a skillcheck.
   Cost: Skill increases awarded by taskmasker are "free" advancement,
   they have no XP or financial cost.
Advance: Instruction by Guild
   Every guild has a teacher who will advance you to some level in all
   skills; however, the level to which they are willing to teach you in
   various skills will depend upon your choice of guild and, in some
   cases, your specialisation within the guild.
     * This is done with the advance command (in the presence of a guild
       teacher).
     * Use the cost command (in the presence of a guild teacher) to see
       how much one or several skill advance will cost.
     * For example: cost primaries, cost magic, cost ma.points, etc.
     * Guilds will advance primaries up to level 300; all other skills are
       taught to a lower level.
     * For example, Priests may advance all faith skills up to level 300
       within the guild, but may only advance magic skills up to level 5.
     * Examples: advance magic, advance ma.sp, advance ma.sp.offensive
     * To advance a skill tree, find the advancement room/person and type
       advance [skill]. So to advance your skill tree for magic type
       "advance magic" without the quotation marks.
     * To advance a branch of a skill, simply type advance [skill.branch]
   Cost: Advancing within your guild is the second cheapest in terms of XP
   cost after taskmaster skill increases, and costs AM$ 12.50 or
   equivalent per 100k XP spent on skills.
Teachers
   All players are able to teach their skill to other players, subject to
   their bonus in the relevant skills being high enough.
     * Learning from another player is considerably more expensive than
       advancing from a guild, but always cheaper (sometimes not by much)
       than learning from yourself (see below).
   Cost: Learning from a teacher has a high XP cost, but generally has no
   financial cost. The teacher receives a portion of the XP you spend in
   return for teaching you.
Self Teaching
   Self teaching is the application of your XP to teaching yourself
   skills.
   Cost: This is the most expensive method, but it has the benefit of
   always being available, and can also be done no matter what level you
   currently have in the skill.

Attack messages
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   The following are the messages given by attack types during combat from
   the distribution mudlib.
   Mudlib-unconf.gif This page contains formulae or data from the
   distribution mudlib. This information may be several years out of date,
   so needs to be verified as correct. You can help by performing research
   to validate it.
   It appears that more powerful attack messages appear when damage
   represents a greater percentage of the victim's total health. This is
   most obvious when comparing fights against very weak opponents (frogs,
   chickens, etc.) versus tough ones. As such, the numbers included below
   from the distribution mudlib are unlikely to be directly representative
   of current code but have been kept in the hope that they might be
   useful.

   From Discworld MUD Wiki

   Tactical special attacks are special attacks which do not do any damage
   to their victim, but instead cause them to incur some degree of
   tactical disadvantage - most commonly, by depleting their action
   points.

Action points
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Action points are what determine how often someone is able to
   physically attack or defend during combat.

Overview
   During combat, each participant has an action point deficit associated
   with them. Whenever that participant physically attacks or defends,
   their deficit increases, with the cost depending on various different
   factors. Action points are replenished - reducing the deficit - at a
   (usually) constant rate with each round that passes.
   Note that unlike all the other 'points' counters, action points levels
   can not be directly viewed by a player - there is no counter that will
   show up with 'score' or any other command. The only way to gauge action
   point levels is via seeing the effects of having overly large or small
   deficits, as detailed below.
Deficits, surpluses and running out of action points
   As action points are used, players acquire offensive and defensive
   action point defecits, equal to the difference between their current
   and maximum action point levels.
   There are critical deficit thresholds associated with offensive and
   defensive actions, which are affected purely by the participant's
   tactics-attitude. The more aggressive attitudes permit the player to
   reach a higher deficit before Bad Things happen to their offense, but a
   lower deficit before Bad Things happen to their defence. The more
   defensive attitudes cause the converse effect.
Critical attacking level effects
     * If a participant has a significantly small deficit in relation to
       the critical offensive level, then they will make two attacks in a
       round.
     * If a participant's deficit increases past the critical offensive
       level, then they will not attack at all that round.
Critical defending level effects
     * Small deficits in relation to the critical defensive level do not
       confer any direct benefits (though it's always nice to have a
       surplus...).
     * If a participant's defensive deficit increases beyond the critical
       defensive level, then that participant does not attempt to defend
       incoming attacks (the attacks automatically hit).
   Note that the deficit level is to a certain extent self-correcting - if
   a fighter has used up too many action points, then their attack and
   defense rate will decrease, causing them to use less action points for
   a while. Conversely, if they have plenty of action points to spare,
   then they will attack faster, using up action points at a faster rate.
Action point cost and regeneration
   Barring effects from special attacks and spellcasting, all participants
   regenerate action points at the same constant rate. However, the action
   point cost of attacking and defending is variable based on the
   following modifiers.
Attacking cost
   The following factors affect the cost of attacking:
     * The attacker's bonus in fighting.special.tactics - higher levels
       reduce the action point cost.
     * Their bonus in the appropriate melee or ranged weapon skill. Again,
       higher levels reduce the cost.
     * The attack cost is increased in relation to the weight of the
       attacker's weapon. This penalty is mitigated somewhat if the weapon
       is held in both hands.
     * The attack cost is reduced if attacking with multiple weapons.
Defending cost
   The following factors affect the cost of defending:
     * The defender's bonus in fighting.special.tactics - higher levels
       reduce the action point cost.
     * Their bonus in the appropriate defence skill. Again, higher levels
       reduce the cost.
     * Various factors associated with their specific means of defense,
       ranging from burden to weapon weight. See dodge, parry and block
       for more details.
     * If the defender defeats the attacker's 'to-hit' skillcheck by a
       large margin (ie. they 'easily' parry/dodge/block), then the cost
       of that defence is halved or (in extreme cases) zeroed. Conversely,
       if they defeat the attacker by a very small margin ('only just
       manage to...'), then the cost of that defence is doubled.
Spellcasting
   While spellcasting, a character regenerates no action points. Note,
   however, that a player can spellcast no matter how great their action
   point deficit is.
Other ways to affect one's own action points
   In general, performing almost any action will increase one's action
   point deficit - the more time you spend doing other things, the less
   time you have to engage in combat. The following are particularly
   worthy of mention:
     * Performing most forms of special attack will cause a significant
       increase in action point deficit.
     * Casting spells also significantly increases action point deficit
       (in addition to not regenerating them).
     * Berserk drastically increases either action point regeneration or
       the critical deficit levels  research If this has been marked on a
       page, it's because there was something that probably isn't known,
       that the person who edited the page thinks could be found out.
       Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be famous evermore. .
     * Attacking an opponent will increase your opponent's action points
       deficit if they try to defend. If they have less action points,
       they can make fewer attacks. If they are making fewer attacks, you
       will spend fewer action points on defense. This will let you make
       more atacks...
          + If you're being attacked by a group of NPCs, you may have a
            huge action point deficit; this may make it difficult, if not
            nearly impossible, to fight back.
          + Traveling in a group of players or using minions can cause
            your opponent to have a high action points deficit.
Ways to affect one's opponent's action points
   There are various special commands which specifically act to consume an
   opponent's action points:
     * Trip
     * Shove
     * Feint
Defending and protecting other players
   Defending or protecting others incurs a significant extra action point
   cost, above and beyond the standard cost of performing a defensive
   action. This reflects the time taken to leap in front of the person
   being defend/protected.
     * Protecting incurs a set action point cost, very roughly equivalent
       to the cost of two attacks with reasonable skills.
     * Defending incurs twice this cost (because it's a lot harder to get
       in the way and parry than just get in the way and be hit), in
       addition to the cost involved in parrying the attack.
     * Guild points
     * Hit points
     * Tactics
     * Trip and shove.
     * Feint
     * Riposte
     * Berserk
     * Parry, dodge and block.
     * Defend and protect.

Tactics
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   This article is about combat settings. For tactics skill, see
   fighting.special.tactics.
   A player's tactics settings determine various options about how they
   will behave during combat.
   These settings can be viewed and set using the 'tactics' command, and
   the options available are explained in detail below.
Contents
     * 1 Response
     * 2 Parry
     * 3 Attack
     * 4 Attitude
     * 5 Focus
     * 6 See also
     * 7 External links
Response
   A player's 'response' setting determines which of the fighting.defence
   skill subtrees they will use to defend themself. It can be set to one
   of four options:
     * Dodge - with this option set, a player will always attempt to dodge
       incoming attacks, and will not attempt to parry or block them.
     * Parry - with this option set, a player will always attempt to parry
       or block incoming attacks (depending on whether the hand(s)
       specified in the 'parry' option below are holding a shield or not).
       They will not attempt to dodge.
     * Block - with this option set, a player will always attempt to block
       incoming attacks. They will not attempt to dodge nor parry.
     * Neutral - with this option set, a player will randomly decide to
       either dodge or block or parry each incoming attack.
   Generally speaking, it is preferable to decide early on whether your
   character is more suited to dodging or parrying or blocking, and set
   your response to one of these accordingly - as attempting to gain
   proficiency in both response types requires twice the amount of XP
   expenditure.
   That said, there is a minor bonus conferred in combat if a player's
   response is neutral, as the enemy isn't sure how the player will react.
Parry
   A player's 'parry' setting determines which hand (or hands) a player
   will use to parry incoming attacks. Obviously, this setting only
   applies if the 'response' setting above is set to either 'parry' or
   'neutral'.
   Available options are:
     * Left - parry only with the left hand.
     * Right - parry only with the right hand.
     * Both - randomly choose which hand to parry with for each attack.
       This confers a very slight reduction in the action point cost of
       parrying, but means that a player may find themself parrying with
       an unfavourable weapon.
     * Unarmed - determines whether the player will attempt to parry when
       unarmed or not (each time this option is set it toggles
       allowing/disallowing unarmed parrying).
   Unarmed parrying may confer some level of protection to a
   parrying-dependent character without their weapons, but it can also be
   disabling if the player isn't skilled enough  research If this has been
   marked on a page, it's because there was something that probably isn't
   known, that the person who edited the page thinks could be found out.
   Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be famous evermore. .
Attack
   A player's 'attack' setting determines which hand(s) are used to
   attack.
   Available options are:
     * Left - attack only with the left hand.
     * Right - attack only with the right hand.
     * Both - randomly choose which hand to attack with for each strike.
       This confers a very slight reduction in the action point cost of
       attacking, but means that a player may find themself attacking with
       an unfavourable weapon.
Attitude
   A player's 'attitude' setting essentially determines how aggressive or
   defensive the player is in combat. This affects a number of things, as
   detailed in the table below.
   Attitude Extra GP drain per attack Extra GP drain per defence Action
   point limit for attacking Action point limit for defending To hit
   modifier To defend modifier
   Insane 1 2 200% 50% +25% -50%
   Offensive 0 1 100% 100% +15% -25%
   Neutral 0 0 66% 150% 0% 0%
   Defensive 1 0 50% 200% -25% +15%
   Wimp 2 1 25% 300% -50% +25%
   The action point limits in the above table should be treated as
   relative to each other for the same skill level, rather than anything
   absolute. Note that a player generally has higher action point limits
   for defending than attacking, as people are prone to avoiding pain.
   The to-hit and to-defend bonuses are roughly equivalent to improving or
   worsening the chance to hit or defend by that much (but be aware that a
   great many other factors also influence this test).
   Having a floater swoop will drain gp when defensive actions cost extra,
   same as dodge, parry or block.
Focus
   A player's 'focus' option determines which part of the body their
   attacks will be aimed at.
   Available options are:
     * Specific parts of the human body (head, neck, chest, abdomen, arms,
       hands, legs, feet) - in which case all attacks will be aimed at
       that area.
     * More general areas - upper body and lower body.
     * None - just choose randomly.
   See here for details on the likelihood of hitting various body parts if
   the 'upper/lower body' or 'none' options are selected. If one of the
   specific areas has been selected, and the target is not humanoid, then
   the target area will be mapped onto a roughly similar area (eg. chest,
   abdomen, arms, legs, hands and feet might all strike the body area of a
   snake).
   Setting focus to a particular area may be useful in that it can be used
   to get avoid armoured areas on the opponent, or to hit more
   damage-sensitive areas (such as the face), however, attempting to focus
   on a specific area incurs a significant to-hit penalty:
     * No penalty for focus 'none'
     * Penalty very roughly equivalent to 25% chance to hit for 'upper
       body' or 'lower body' focus.
     * Penalty very roughly equivalent to 0 to 25% chance to hit for
       focusing on specific areas, depending on how big the area is
       (bigger areas incur a lesser penalty).
     * Action points
     * Dodge, parry and block.
     * Weapons and armour.

   Dodging is the means of defence by which an the defender avoids an
   incoming physical attack by moving out of the way.
Contents
     * 1 Applicability
     * 2 Mechanics
          + 2.1 Chance of dodging
          + 2.2 Action point cost
     * 3 Somehow avoid
     * 4 Spellcasting
     * 5 Defend and riposte
     * 6 See also
     * 7 Footnotes
Applicability
   Dodging can only be used to avoid physical attacks, thus it is useless
   against magic.
   Dodging can be used to avoid either a melee attack or a ranged attack;
   if successfully executed then the defender takes no damage.
   In order to dodge, tactics-response must be set to either 'neutral' or
   'dodge'.
Mechanics
   There are two factors associated with dodging:
     * How likely is an incoming attack to be dodged?
     * How many action points does dodging an attack cost?
   These are addressed below:
Chance of dodging
   A character's basic chance of dodging an incoming attack is determined
   by a skillcheck of their fighting.defence.dodging skill against the
   relevant weapon skill of the attacker (eg. fighting.melee.sword or
   fighting.range.thrown).
   This chance is then modified by the following factors specific to the
   defender's dodging^[1]:
     * There is a penalty to dodging in direct proportion to the degree of
       burden of the defender. It's hard to leap out of the way of an
       attack in time when you're lugging a lot of equipment about.
     * Additionally, there is a further penalty based on burden if your
       burden level is more than twice your dexterity stat. This is a
       considerably more dramatically increasing penalty than the one
       above, and is best avoided.
     * There is a minor bonus to dodging proportional to the weight of the
       attacker's weapon (heavier weapons are slower, thus easier to
       dodge).
Action point cost
   The action point cost of dodging starts at a constant base level, and
   is then modified as follows:
     * The cost is reduced with higher skills in fighting.defence.dodging
       and fighting.special.tactics.
     * There is a diminishing-returns penalty based on the burden of the
       dodger (the more burdened you are, the more momentum you need to
       overcome after dodging).
Somehow avoid
   If a defender does not have enough action points to dodge, but their
   dodging bonus is significantly higher than an attacker's melee bonus,
   they might somehow avoid the attack anyway.
You slice at the huge whirlwind of ice with your steel naginata but, although un
able to defend, it somehow avoids the attack.
   This effectively results in a defence that costs no action points. By
   using an insane tactics-attitude, a player with a sufficiently high
   dodging bonus may spend all of their action points on attacking but
   still somehow avoid attacks.
   Somehow avoiding is unique to having a high fighting.defence.dodging
   bonus. Fighting.defence.parrying and fighting.defence.blocking do not
   have this benefit. Note that you may somehow avoid even if you use a
   tactics-response of parry or block.
   On 15 Oct '21, Pit posted on a discussion about somehow avoid to say
   that this is essentially a bug, but that he was reticent to fix it for
   reasons:
 The existence of somehow avoids *is* a bug, and it's even trivially easy to fix
 (it's a 5-letter fix; I almost did it just as a routine fix before someone info
rmed me that doing so would kill off half the playerbase). You don't lightly cha
nge a feature that players have built their playstyle around.
   On 18 Oct 2021, the odds to "somehow avoid" was reduced by 5%,
   reportedly it was 100% before if you had a much higher dodge bonus
   against your opponent's attack skill bonus.
Spellcasting
   For the duration of spellcasting or hedgehog, the caster will attempt
   to dodge, parry or block incoming attacks as their settings specify in
   their tactics-response. Their chance of defending successfully is
   reduced, and they do not recover action points while casting.
Defend and riposte
   Defend and riposte are incompatible with dodging; if a player's
   response is set to 'dodge', they will be unable to perform either of
   these actions.

     * Block
     * Arcane shielding

Block
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
          This article is a stub. You can help Discworld MUD Wiki by
          expanding it.
   "Block" is a passive defense which prevents an opponent from landing a
   blow in combat.
   It depends on a player's bonus in fighting.defence.blocking and
   controlled by the option options.combat.tactics settings (dedicated
   block users attack with one hand and block with the other). Holding a
   shield, along with the qualities of the shield and the skills of the
   attacker all factor into the success of a block.
   In addition to blocking attacks, the player also gains the absorb
   mechanic (or rather, holding a shield protects the user on an unknown
   level and acts like armour with unknown coverage, absorbs can be quite
   powerful but are vastly unknown as to what causes the ability to
   trigger.) Absorbs cost little to no ap and basically just add to the
   defense of the character.
   Block has yet to be tested extensively, or the people that have done
   the testing haven't shared it here.
   (Check "discussion" for notes from users about block as I'm trying to
   keep this page clear of theorycrafting, a good idea of block can be
   gotten from checking out the page on parry and checking the notes in
   discussion.)

   Parrying is the means of defence by which an the defender deflects an
   incoming physical attack with their weapon.

     * 6 Footnotes
Applicability
   Parrying can only be used to deflect physical attacks, thus it is
   useless against magic.
   Parrying can be used to deflect either a melee attack or a ranged
   attack; if successfully executed then the defender takes no damage.
   In order to parry, one must be holding a weapon with tactics-response
   set to either 'neutral' or 'parry', or unarmed with the 'unarmed parry'
   tactics response option set. The tactics-parry setting must either be
   set to 'both', or to a hand the player is holding a weapon in.
   Note that parrying is not performed using a shield - see block for
   deflecting attacks with a shield.
Mechanics
   There are two factors associated with parrying:
     * How likely is an incoming attack to be parried?
     * How many action points does parrying an attack cost?
   These are addressed below:
Chance of parrying
   A character's basic chance of parrying an incoming attack is determined
   by a skillcheck of their fighting.defence.parrying skill against the
   relevant weapon skill of the attacker (eg. fighting.melee.sword or
   fighting.range.thrown).
   This chance is then modified by the following factors specific to the
   defender's parrying^[1]:
     * The weapon's weight vs. the wielder's strength. Essentially, an
       easily-carried weapon provides a bonus to parrying, while a weapon
       carried with difficulty incurs a penalty. Note that this check can
       be made more easy by holding the parrying weapon in both hands.
     * The weight of the parrying weapon vs. the weight of the attacking
       weapon. If your weapon is heavier than your opponent's, then you
       gain a (limited) bonus to parrying. If on the other hand your
       weapon is lighter than your opponent's, then you incur an unlimited
       penalty to parrying as conservation of momentum pushes your weapon
       away faster.
     * Certain weapons have inherent bonuses to parrying, such as the
       custom fencing blade from the Genuan Musketeers' Guild.  research

       that probably isn't known, that the person who edited the page
       thinks could be found out. Perhaps you could figure this thing out,
       and be famous evermore.
     * Axes have an inherent penalty to parry chance. There may also be
       penalties for other weapon types  research If this has been marked
       on a page, it's because there was something that probably isn't
       known, that the person who edited the page thinks could be found
       out. Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be famous
       evermore. .
     * There is a penalty to parrying in direct proportion to the degree
       of burden of the defender. It's hard to get your weapon in place in
       time when you're lugging a lot of equipment about.
     * There is a dexterity dependent penalty for parrying with a weapon
       in the 'off-hand'^[2]
Action point cost
   The action point cost of parrying starts at a constant base level based
   on your parrying weapon, and is then modified as follows:
     * The cost is reduced with higher skills in fighting.special.tactics
       and by winning the check of your fighting.defence.parrying against
       the attacker's weapon skill by larger margins.
     * There is a small bonus for parrying with both hands (because you
       only need to move whichever happens to be closest to the attack;
       this will be less far on average than with one weapon). It is
       almost always better to parry with both hands than just one.
     * There is an action point penalty for parrying with an axe. There
       may also be penalties for other weapon types   research If this has
       been marked on a page, it's because there was something that
       probably isn't known, that the person who edited the page thinks
       could be found out. Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be
       famous evermore. .
     * There is a diminishing-returns penalty based on the weight of the
       parrying weapon (the heavier it is, the more momentum you need to
       overcome after parrying). As with the chance to parry, this is
       reduced by holding the parrying weapon in both hands.
Defending
   Parry can be used (along with block, but not dodge) to defend another
   player. By this means, a player can attempt to parry blows aimed at
   another player, without exposing themself to risk in the same way that
   protect does. Note however that:
     * A failed parry results in the defended target getting hit.
     * Defending another player incurs a very high action point cost on
       the defender, which may well prevent them from defending attacks
       aimed at themself. Thus, defend is not entirely risk-free.
Riposte
   If a player is using parry as their defensive skill, then they can
   attempt to riposte an incoming attack - this causes them to attempt a
   special counter-attack following the next successful parry. The weapon
   must have a spike or point, as the riposte attack is pierce based.

Experience points
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Experience points (or XP) are a measure of how much a player has learnt
   from their experience. They are earned by various means - most
   significantly by killing enemies - and can be spent to increase levels
   in skills.

Gaining experience points
   There exist many ways by which experience points can be gained:
Kill and burial XP
   Kill XP is earned when a player kills an enemy, and burial XP is
   awarded when the corpse is buried. The amount of XP rewarded increases
   in relation to the 'difficulty' of the target killed.
   Note that:
     * You can only get burial XP once per victim - recovering the corpse
       and re-burying it does not award further XP.
     * You can only get burial XP within five minutes of the npc dying.
       Corpses buried after this time give no XP.
     * Even when npcs seem identical, they often give different amounts of
       kill and burial XP. E.g. three farmers in the melon farms outside
       Djelibeybi will give three different amounts of XP.
     * Npcs that don't leave behind corpses--such as zombies, vampires,
       mommets, eggplants--seem to just give kill xp.
   Kill and burial XP are related, but work somewhat differently. Kill XP
   appears to start out the same as the burial XP, but it's adjusted
   downwards in a few ways that burial XP is not:
     * If the victor is of higher guild level than the victim, then the XP
       is scaled down according to the ratio of their levels (eg. a level
       200 player killing a level 100 victim only gets half the XP that a
       level 100 player killing the same victim would).
     * The XP is scaled down in proportion to the victor's wimpy level (so
       a wimpy of 10% results in 90% of the XP being awarded, for
       example).
     * If the victor's XP rate is over 100,000 XP/hour, kill XP is scaled
       down, apparently according to the ratio of 100,000 to your rate (so
       that when your rate is 200,000 XP/hour, you'll get half the kill XP
       you normally would, and when it's 500,000 XP/hour, you'll get a
       fifth).
     * If the npc is in combat with you, but you are not actually in the
       room when it dies, you only get half of "your share" ("your share"
       being the amount you would have gotten if you had been in the room
       when it died and not grouped with other combatants) of the kill xp.
   Burial XP, on the other hand, is only penalized when your hourly rate
   reaches 500,000 xp/hour (as with most types of xp), apparently
   according to the ratio of 500,000 to your rate. Also, unlike with kill
   XP, if you're not in the room when the corpse is buried, you still get
   your share of the burial XP (although you only get your own share, not
   any shared burial xp from groupmates).
   There are several things you can do to get rid of corpses besides
   burying them normally:
     * Ritually bury: When you ritually bury a corpse, you get the same
       burial XP as usual--but at the same time, you get XP from the
       command itself. If you fail to ritually bury a corpse, you get the
       command XP, but not the burial XP--if this happens, you can still
       bury the corpse normally to get the burial XP.
     * In some rooms, such as on bridges, corpses that are "buried" show
       up in the room below. You get burial XP when you "bury" it this
       way--there's no need to go to the room below and bury it again.
     * Order creeping doom to devour: Ordering a creeping doom to devour a
       corpse is incompatible with getting burial XP from that corpse. You
       get no XP when it devours it, and it won't devour a corpse that's
       been buried.
     * Turn corpse into spectre: If you perform Unquiet Spirit to turn a
       corpse into a spectre, you won't get burial XP. You can, however,
       perform the ritual on corpses that have been buried and recovered.
     * Destroy with Withering Touch: If you perform Withering Touch on a
       corpse to destroy it, you will get burial XP. You can only perform
       the ritual on corpses that haven't been buried yet.
   It makes no difference whatsoever who deals the deathblow or who
   performs the actual burial. Even if someone who wasn't in combat with
   the npc buries the corpse, you'll get the same amount of burial XP.
Division and sharing of kill and burial xp
   When an npc is fighting multiple people^[1]--who are either in the same
   room or at most one room away^[2]--the kill and bury XP awarded by that
   npc will be affected. First, the kill and bury XP are divided by the
   number of people the npc is in combat with (again, only counting people
   in the same room as the npc or immediately adjacent rooms). Then, a
   small amount--perhaps 10 or 12 XP for two people--seems to be added.
   After any division that takes place, kill and bury XP are shared with
   groupmates as follows:
     * Up to half of each person's kill and burial XP is shared with any
       groupmates who are in the same room and less than five minutes
       idle. This sharing takes the form of giving free XP to your
       groupmates--your own XP isn't diminished by it.
     * If a groupmate's guild level is less than half of your own, you
       only share a fraction of your kill and burial xp equal to (their
       guild level/your guild level), instead of half.
     * You do share kill and burial XP with non-combatant groupmates.
       However, combatants will get more kill and burial XP overall, since
       they get their own share of the kill and burial XP in addition to
       shared XP from groupmates.
   Note that pets and fruitbats being in combat do cause the xp to be
   divided, but they don't share any, even with their owners or summoners.
   This includes moon dragons--despite the fact that as soon as they're
   attacked, they fly up to perch on your shoulder and so aren't involved
   in the combat beyond draining xp.
   The end result for the simplest case--where all combatants have the
   same guild level and are grouped with each other--is that each person
   gets half of solo XP, plus solo XP divided by twice the number of
   combatants, plus a bit (from the small amount that is added after the
   division, and then shared).
   Grouped combatants Approximate kill and burial XP for each combatant
   1                  100%
   2                  75%
   3                  67%
   4                  63%
   5                  60%
   6                  58%
   Since non-combatant groupmates in the same room will get half of their
   combatant groupmates' kill and burial XP shared with them, this adds up
   to 50%^[3] regardless of the number of combatants.
   It's worth emphasizing that this only holds true for that simplest
   case. More typically, group members will not all have exactly the same
   guild level, even if they are similar, so they will get different
   amounts of kill xp to begin with (and, of course, share different
   amounts of kill xp with their groupmates).
   Interestingly, groupmates with lower guild levels can raise the overall
   amount of XP you get from an npc, because their lower guild level
   causes them to receive more kill XP, which is then partially passed on.
   Totems and dust devils are a little more complex in the way they share
   XP. They will share up to half their kill and bury XP with their
   summoner, but only a quarter of it with the summoner's groupmates. So,
   for the summoner, they act as an extra groupmate, but for the
   summoner's groupmates they'll "drain" more XP. If one of these minions
   disappears (i.e. is dismissed or dies) before the npc dies, it won't be
   included in the division: it will be as though the minion was never in
   the fight. However, it if disappears after the death but before the
   burial, it will be included in the division of burial XP, but won't
   share any of the burial xp. It's therefore a good idea to bury before
   your minions disappear.
Command XP
   Nearly all guild commands give XP when executed. For the most part, the
   amount of xp they give is twenty times the amount of gp spent. However,
   if the gp spent is 5 or less (such as with value, or fueling a
   broomstick with 5 gp or less), no xp is given.
   This XP award is reduced based on how often the command in question has
   been executed and how many other commands have been executed in the
   meantime. Every time the player executes a command (or casts a
   particular spell/ritual), the MUD increments a count for that command.
   The counter is halved if the command hasn't been executed in the last 5
   minutes. The XP award is divided by (1 + count) if the count is less
   than 10, and is set to zero if the count is 10 or more.
   As of November 1, 2012[1], command xp is no longer shared with
   groupmates.
Heartbeat XP
   The simplest of all XP to gain, heartbeat XP is a uniform 3 XP per
   'heartbeat'--until your xp rate reaches 500,000 XP/hour, at which point
   it drops to 2 XP per heartbeat (and further drops when your xp rate
   reaches higher amounts). The heartbeat rate is approximately one per
   two seconds, though this varies in periods of lag.
Exploration XP
   Exploration XP is a small amount of XP  research If this has been
   marked on a page, it's because there was something that probably isn't
   known, that the person who edited the page thinks could be found out.
   Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be famous evermore.
   awarded to a player whenever they enter a room that nobody else has
   entered for a while. You can get exploration XP from entering a room
   which already contains an npc or another player (although the other
   player presumably must have been sitting there for a while), and you
   can get it from entering a room you just looked into. For the most
   part, you get exploration xp from non-terrain rooms--rooms in cities,
   villages, etc. While you usually get no xp from terrain rooms, you can
   sometimes get small amounts on the roads in the terrains.
   Exploration xp seems to range from around 0 to 470 xp per room, with
   the higher amounts being rarer. It's unclear what determines the amount
   you can get; it may be random.
   Rooms don't seem to give exploration XP shortly after a reboot.
   There are achievements in the Exploration category for getting various
   amounts of exploration XP:
     * Achievement: Novice Explorer
     * Achievement: The Happy Wanderer
     * Achievement: Across The Universe
Mission and job XP
   Jobs, or missions, give varying amounts of XP and money, depending on
   the specific job. You can do them as many times as you like.
   Some jobs have a waiting period before you can get another one. With
   others, you can get another one of the same type right away (if it's
   available), but you'll get less XP and money from it.
   With sausage-making missions in particular, if the mission is done
   while grouped, the xp is split evenly among groupmates.
   Agatean family missions work differently. You cannot apply for a
   specific mission, but are assigned one randomly when you ask for a
   mission. You must be a member of the family to do missions for them,
   and you must wait half an hour between finishing (or failing) a mission
   before you can get another one.
Quest XP
   Quests give an amount of XP related to the QP value of the
   quest  research If this has been marked on a page, it's because there
   was something that probably isn't known, that the person who edited the
   page thinks could be found out. Perhaps you could figure this thing
   out, and be famous evermore. .
   Level XP awarded
   1     15000
   2     40000
   3     75000
   4     120000
   5     175000
   6     240000
   7     310000
   8     400000
Achievement XP
   Achievements give an amount of XP related to the level of the
   achievement, as follows:
     Level   XP awarded
   Minor     5000
   Small     15000
   Moderate  35000
   Large     75000
   Huge      155000
   Massive   627500
   Epic      1267500
   Legendary 2547500
   Mythic    5107500
Teaching XP
   Teaching another player skills results in the teacher being awarded the
   XP spent by the student raised to the power of 0.8 for each level that
   the teacher was able to teach without difficulty, reduced by 50% for a
   level where the teacher failed the teaching skillcheck.
Newspaper XP
   Writing articles for newspapers gives XP as follows:
     * The authors of the each article get 60000 XP.
     * The newspaper's editors get 10% of the total article XP, plus
       120000 XP; the editor XP is divided up between all the editors.
Resurrection XP
   Successfully resurrecting someone gives the priest a portion of the xp
   that the former ghost got returned. This seems to be equal to the xp
   returned to the ghost, raised to the power of .77 or .78. However, this
   xp is subject to penalties due to xp rate.
Spending XP
   Players spend their XP by increasing their skills, by one of the
   following means:
     * Advancing their skills at their guild.
     * Learning from another player.
     * Learning from themself.
   Advancing skills at the guild is significantly cheaper than learning
   from players. Learning from another player is marginally cheaper than
   learning from yourself; the cost saving is dependent on the ratio
   between your level and their effective teaching bonus.
   These graphs show the cost of advancing via various means:
                     XPlearn0 300.gif         XPlearn300 600.gif
   Cost of advancing 1 level
   (levels 0 to 300) Cost of advancing 1 level
   (levels 300 to 600)
Death and losing XP
   The only way to lose XP without spending it is to die. What happens
   next depends on how the player is brought to life again:
     * If raised, then they come back to life with none of the XP they had
       when they died.
     * If resurrected, then they will come back with a percentage of their
       former XP dependent on the Pishite's skills. This can be up to 75%
       of the xp they had when they died.
   Any xp gained while dead will be kept when either raised or
   resurrected. While dead, you can gain exploration and (ironically)
   heartbeat xp.
XP rate
   Your XP rate--or at least, the rate that is relevant here--is always
   your rate over the past hour^[4]--in other words, the amount of XP
   you've made in the past hour. Quest and achievement XP are not included
   in your rate. Heartbeat XP, exploration XP, kill and burial XP, command
   XP, resurrection XP, family mission XP, and XP from jobs are included.
   Your rate only seems to change while you're logged on, with time spent
   logged out not counted.
   The easiest way to check your xp rate is by checking your progress on
   any unattained achievements in the Numberchasing category. You may also
   be able to get plugins for your client which will tell you your rate,
   though some will show your average rate since you logged in or reset
   the plugin.
   There are several achievements related to your rate:
     * Achievement: Xp Grinder: 100k/hour
     * Achievement: Ex Peas 4 Me: 200k/hour
     * Achievement: Hey Pesto: 400k/hour
     * Achievement: Experiential Learning: 600k/hour
     * Achievement: Numberchasing Nirvana: 800k/hour
     * Achievement: Good Day: 1 million per hour
   Allowing a broader definition of "rate", there are also two epic
   achievements for gaining 5 million XP in a single session,
   during--respectively--a single Disc day or a single Disc night.
     * Achievement: Day Tripper
     * Achievement: A Hard Day's Night
XP reduction
   XP reduction is applied to all forms of income (though not in the exact
   same way for all of them): kill, bury, command, teaching, resurrection
   and even heartbeat XP. Income is reduced based on the total XP earned
   by a player in the previous hour (XP rate). For types of XP other than
   kill xp, no reduction is applied until a player's rate exceeds 500,000
   XP/hr; as a player's rate increases futher, the reduction is also
   increased. The formula for determining the percentage of your normal xp
   that you actually get for XP rates over 500,000 XP/hr is:-
XP percentage = 50,000,000 / XP rate
   So, for example, when your rate is exactly 500,000, your percentage is
   100%: you're still getting full xp. But if your rate is 750,000, your
   percentage is 66%: you're only getting 2/3 of the xp you normally would
   get.
   Kill XP is reduced earlier, when a player's rate exceeds 100,000 XP/hr.
   For it, the formula is:
XP percentage = 10,000,000 / XP rate
   So, when your rate is 500,000, you're only getting 20% of your normal
   kill xp.
The XP cap
   You can't carry an unlimited amount of XP: the amount you can have at
   one time is capped at thirty million. The way this seems to work is
   that if getting a chunk of XP would put you over the cap, you don't get
   any of it. For example, if you have 29,999,800 XP and you do something
   that would normally give you 250 XP, nothing happens. Therefore, when
   you get very close to the cap, you'll begin to stop getting XP for
   things. Given this, if your heartbeat XP is, at that time, 3 XP per
   heartbeat, you might stop at 29,999,98; 29,999,99; or 30,000,000 XP
   exactly.
   Even though you don't get XP yourself at this point, you can still
   share XP with groupmates. It appears to work normally, except that you
   share out of what you would have gotten, had you been able to, instead
   of what you actually got (0).
   It's generally a good idea to spend your XP far before you reach the
   cap, as dying at 30 million will cost you, at minimum, 7.5 million XP.

Footnotes
    1. ↑ Note that "people the npc is in combat with" can include: other
       players (whether grouped or not), pets, fruitbats, hired
       mercenaries, totems, and dust devils. (Skeleton warriors from the
       "Grisald's Reanimated Guardian" wizard spell are a special case,
       and don't seem to count at all: you can use one without any
       reduction in xp for yourself or your groupmates.) The calm ritual
       will cause the npc to stop fighting anyone who's not in the room,
       as well as the performer. Chant has a wider effect--it can also
       cause everyone in the room to stop fighting, though it is
       pk-checked. However, just "stop"ping fighting will not make the npc
       stop fighting you.
    2. ↑ Changed on December 6, 2015, and announced here.
    3. ↑ More precisely, 50% of the average of what each combatant
       groupmate would get from killing and burying that npc solo.
    4. ↑ Actually, the MUD appears to use the amount of xp you've made in
       the last fifty-nine and a half minutes or so--NOT a full hour--for
       your rate. The exact amount of time seems to vary somewhat, though.
       You can see this effect if you check your progress in a
       numberchasing achievement repeatedly about an hour after you gained
       some amount of XP, and see when that chunk of XP disappears from
       your rate. This does, however, assume that the achievements are
       tied to your rate as calculated by the MUD for other purposes, and
       that they don't have some separate system for calculating it.

Consider
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   The consider command attempts to measure your combat ability against
   that of a potential foe. As players get stronger, the command becomes
   less accurate, having to take into consideration many different
   factors.
   People and NPCs being considered will be notified of the attempt and
   may react. A common NPC reaction is drawing weapons, which also serves
   to make the command more accurate. A player may attempt to consider
   covertly, which can be used to consider without notifying the target.

Notes
     * A dog considered a lot weaker, but was able to shred me. (This may
       have been because I didn't have the skills to keep parrying an
       unarmed opponent.)
     * Switching from a twenty pound mail hauberk to a thirty pound
       jazerant didn't seem to make a difference in considers.
     * Unholding/holding weapons varies consider depending on a persons
       skills. For example, Imperial Guards will typically judge one or
       two notches lower until they draw their weapons. The same applies
       for the Hashishim in Djelibeybi.
     * There's plenty of room - tens of bonus - in which a meleeist will
       be quagmired in ambiguous 'about equal' territory.
     * Once upon a time, you could give items to NPCs. Once you gave
       enough stuff to them, they would consider easier. This likely
       coincides with the dex loss from burden or due combat penalties
       from burden. However, you can no longer do this but you may be able
       to plant heavy items on them as well such as hundreds of AM pence.
       This may have been fixed.
     * Another interesting oddity is that NPCs will sometimes consider
       differently Very briefly when they first appear, regardless of
       equipment. It may be that the stats/skills for the NPC have not
       been set yet.
   Don't forget consider covert for a way of TM'ing co.po and co.ca.pe as
   this has no skill prerequisites!

Hit points
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Hit points (also known as Health points or just HP) are a measure of a
   player's vitality. When the player takes damage by any means, they lose
   hit points. If their hit points fall below zero, they get a visit from
   he who talks like this.
Contents
     * 1 Maximum hit points
     * 2 Hit point regeneration
     * 3 Ways to recover hit points
     * 4 Viewing hitpoints
     * 5 See also
     * 6 External links
Maximum hit points
   HP to weight factor
   The maximum amount of hit points a player has is mostly controlled by
   their bonus in adventuring.health. There is also an effect from the
   player's weight.
   To determine a player's maximum hit point total, read off the 'weight
   factor' from the graph to the right based on the player's weight, and
   then apply the following formula:
Max HP = floor( (150 + 10 * con + 4 * ad.he bonus) * weight-factor )
Hit point regeneration
   The rate at which hitpoints regenerate is controlled by the player's
   constitution and strength stats, with a stronger emphasis on the
   former. Specifically, it is:
HP regen per round = rounddown(sqrt(200/9.8 * (4 * ln(con) + ln (str)) - 50) - 1
0)
Ways to recover hit points
          See also: Category:Healing
   Beyond waiting for them to regenerate, players can recover hit points
   via any of the following means:
     * Drink healing tea (restores health over time or blue water (instant
       boost).
     * Eat a chocolate sword or some foods.
     * Smell a healing rose (restores health over time).
     * Perform any of the following priest rituals:
          + Cure Light Wounds
          + Cure Medium Wounds
          + Cure Serious Wounds
          + Heal
     * Bandage with a strip of cloth.
     * Zap with an oak wand.
     * Heal with the blade of Soyin.
     * Relax in some hot springs or PK combat arena baths.
   Players can also use stat items to increase their constitution or
   strength stats, which may result in an increase in the natural hit
   point regeneration rate.
   Splint can be used when legs are broken to reduce damage done when
   walking and to mend your legs after some time.
   For most horse illnesses you can ask a witch for treat.
Viewing hitpoints
   Players can view their current and maximum hitpoints via the score
   command. If the player is in combat or otherwise in most situations
   where the player takes damage, the monitor will show up detailing their
   current and maximum hitpoints.
   Players can see approximately what fraction of their maximum hitpoints
   another character has by using the health command, or if grouped with
   that player, by using 'group status'.

Burden
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Mudlib-semiconf.gif This page contains formulae or data from the
   distribution mudlib. The data has been partially verified as up to
   date. You can help by filling in research on the topic.
   A player's burden is a measure of how much difficulty they are having
   carrying things and moving around due to the encumbrance of their
   inventory.
Contents
     * 1 Burden calculation
     * 2 Effects of burden
          + 2.1 Dexterity penalties
          + 2.2 Picking up and dropping things
          + 2.3 Combat efficiency
          + 2.4 Buoyancy
     * 3 See also
Burden calculation
   Your burden is calculated as follows:
     * Add up the weight of all items in your possession, in all your
       containers.
          + Worn items count as half their weight.
          + Items held in one hand count as twice their weight.
          + Items held in two hands count as 1.5x their weight.
          + Shields still count as 1x their weight when held.
     * Determine your maximum carrying capacity as:
Maximum carrying capacity (lb) = 1.89 * (20 + strength + strength^2/5)
   This gives:
          + 8 strength: 77.112 lb
          + 9 strength: 85.428 lb
          + 10 strength: 94.5 lb
          + 11 strength: 104.328 lb
          + 12 strength: 114.912 lb
          + 13 strength: 126.252 lb
          + 14 strength: 138.348 lb
          + 15 strength: 151.2 lb
          + 16 strength: 164.808 lb
          + 17 strength: 179.172 lb
          + 18 strength: 194.292 lb
          + 19 strength: 210.168 lb
          + 20 strength: 226.8 lb
          + 21 strength: 244.188 lb
          + 22 strength: 262.332 lb
          + 23 strength: 281.232 lb
          + 24 strength: 300.888 lb
          + 25 strength: 321.3 lb
     * Divide the first by the second to get your burden level.
Effects of burden
   Burden has the following effects:
Dexterity penalties
     * 50-74% burden results in a -1 dex penalty.
     * 74-99% burden results in a -2 dex penalty.
     * 100-124% burden results in a -3 dex penalty.
   And so on. It's possible to get up to 200% burden by holding a box
   containing exactly your maximum burden's worth of weight in it, or
   (very temporarily) to 400% and higher by wearing very heavy custom
   armour and then taking severe strength penalties.
Picking up and dropping things
     * Your carrying capacity is separate from your burden.
     * Since wearing things halves their effect on your burden and holding
       things doubles it, the point where you're maxed out and can't pick
       up any more can be anywhere from 50% to 200% depending on how much
       of your stuff is worn or held.
     * You can only take something out or put something into bags and
       other containers that you're carrying if you've got enough "space"
       to carry another of it.
     * If your carried weight changes such that it exceeds 100% of max
       (for example, due to a loss of strength), then you will
       automatically drop items to reduce it below 100% again.
Combat efficiency
     * Burden negatively affects one's 'to-hit' chance with all weapons.
     * If fighting unarmed, then there is an additional 'to-hit' penalty
       from burden.
     * Burden negatively affects one's ability to successfully parry or
       dodge an incoming attack.
     * An additional penalty to dodging occurs if your burden is over
       twice your dexterity stat.
     * Burden increases the action point cost of dodging.
Buoyancy
   The more burden a player has, the more trouble they will have staying
   afloat while swimming. This can be counteracted somewhat by effects
   that increase a player's buoyancy, such as being a witch or wearing an
   aquamarine magick crystal or swim ring.

Pursue
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Pursue is a command that causes your character to follow another
   without their consent. The other character may choose to lose you. This
   will match your adventuring.movement.following.pursuit against their
   adventuring.movement.following.evade. Flying away on a broomstick or
   using Divine Hand will also break pursuit, as can using skillchecked or
   restricted exits (for example, exits into worshipper-only areas of
   temples, or Order rooms).
   It is also possible to suppress your ability to evade and lead on
   someone with the setting:
options combat suppress_evade=on
   Those who are being led in this fashion get skill checks to notice
   this.
   NPCs who use the pursuit command are fairly rare. Some--like
   cheetahs--only pursue if you attack them, while others--like Coffee
   Nostra hitmen, lynxes, yeti, and ice giants--pursue and then attack
   you. They may stop pursuing after some time has passed.
   Watchmen will also pursue, but even Captain Angua won't actually kill
   you.
Delayed pursuit
   Some npcs use another form of pursuit when in combat. This isn't the
   same as the command, and they don't follow you into the room
   immediately--instead, they enter the room they saw you go into after
   several seconds.
   Many npcs in cities use this.

Follow
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Follow is a command that causes your character to follow another. They
   must accept the follow request for you to start following them,
   although the options under "options auto follow" will let you
   automatically accept follow requests from everyone, from friends, or
   from group members.
   Unlike pursue, there is no skillcheck to continue following someone,
   and if they use Divine Hand or Visit you will go with them. However,
   you can't follow a witch on a broomstick, and if an exit is restricted
   (as with worshipper-only areas of temples) you can be left behind:
   following doesn't bypass the restriction. Similarly, if an exit is
   skillchecked (as with climb exits and swimming) it's possible to fail
   the skillcheck and be left behind.
   The "unfollow" command stops you following someone, and the "lose"
   command stops someone following you.
Groups and following
   If you're in a group, you'll automatically follow the group leader. You
   can also use "group follow <member(s)>" (or "group follow all") to
   follow other group members, and "group unfollow <member(s)>" to stop
   following them.
NPCs and following
   Typically, minions will automatically follow you--and you may
   automatically follow them upon summoning them. Pets, too, usually
   follow you, although they may get left behind if you use Divine Hand.
   Most other npcs will not accept follow requests; you'll have to use
   pursue or just manually go through the exits you see them go through.
   One exception is Khepresh of Hat, who will let you follow him and who
   periodically uses Visit. Another exception is the npc you must escort
   in Agatean family missions.

Armour
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   This page details the nature and mechanics of armour on the Discworld
   MUD. For our armour database, click here.
   A piece of armour is a worn item which protects its wearer from a
   certain degree of physical damage.

     * 1 Damage protection

Damage protection
Factors
   Various factors affect the degree of damage protection afforded by a
   piece of armour:
     * Its condition - the better the condition, the higher protection it
       confers.  research If this has been marked on a page, it's because
       there was something that probably isn't known, that the person who
       edited the page thinks could be found out. Perhaps you could figure
       this thing out, and be famous evermore.
     * The quality of material it is made out of. Higher quality materials
       (for example, klatchian steel) provide more protection than lower
       quality materials (for example, wood), although they also tend to
       be heavier. Note that materials confer differing levels of
       protection against different attack types. For example, chainmail
       provides good protection against sharp, slashing attacks, but is
       rather poor against piercing or bludgeoning attacks.
     * The degree of enchantment of the armour - higher enchantment levels
       increase the protection provided. Heavier armour can benefit more
       from enchantment than light armour can.
   The vurdere command can be used to indicate a crude approximation of
   the degree of damage protection afforded by a piece of armour.
Defensive ordering
   Armour is one of the last defensive layers to be applied. Its effect on
   incoming damage is calculated after the following have been applied:
     * Endorphin's Floating Friend and Grammer Scorbic's Household Guard.
     * Dodge, parry and block.
     * Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator, Sorklin's Field of Protection
       and Mama Kolydina's Instant Infestation.
     * Major Shield and Minor Shield
   Armour's effect is applied before the following:
     * Chrenedict's Corporeal Covering
Coverage and layers
   Armour does not automatically protect a player from all attacks when
   worn - only the armour that is worn upon the part of the body that is
   hit has any effect. Hence, gauntlets will only protect the hands, while
   a mail vest will protect the chest, but not the feet. Many pieces of
   armour affect multiple areas of the body - for example, a Grflx scale
   protects the back, chest and arms.
   Multiple pieces of armour can be worn over a particular body area, but
   only as long as their 'clothing layer' does not clash with anything
   else worn over that area. For example, a chainmail coif and a steel
   helm can both be worn over the head simultaneously, whereas a close
   helm and a great helm cannot be worn together. The name of an item do
   not always match the layer slot that it actually fits in - for example,
   a chainmail miniskirt actually fits in the suspender-belt slot since it
   conflicts with those items, not the miniskirt slot. Also, some pieces
   of armour fit in multiple slots, such as the offler-headed mask, which
   counts as both a helm and a mask.
   You can see which areas a piece of armour protects by using the vurdere
   command on it. Alternately, you can see which of all your armour is
   protecting which body areas by using the coverage command like so:
coverage armours except jewellery
   It is necessary to exclude jewellery because for some reason they are
   considered to be armour by the parser even though they do not have the
   protecting capacity of real armour.

   See layers for more layers including the non-armour bits.

Clothing substitution
   However, since armour is very heavy, even with the lightest armour,
   which being made of leather gets to be extremely warming, it is
   possible to substitute some armour pieces for pieces of clothing for
   the purpose of testing layers.

Condition and durability
   As armour absorbs damage, its condition degrades. This makes it less
   effective in reducing damage and, in extreme cases, can cause the item
   to be destroyed if its condition falls to a low enough level.
   The degree of damage to the armour itself is affected by:
     * How much damage the armour absorbs from each attack - the more
       damage absorbed, the more the armour's condition degrades.
     * The material the armour is made out of, and its weight - higher
       quality and heavier armour degrades slower.
     * The degree of enchantment on the armour - more enchanted armour
       degrades slower.
   Damage to armour can be fixed by repairing it in a smithy,
   leatherworking shop or woodworking shop as appropriate to the material
   it is made out of. The condition of armour is apparent by looking at
   it, or otherwise by using the command 'condition <armour(s)>'.
Mechanics - damage absorption
   Mudlib-unconf.gif This section contains formulae or data from the
   distribution mudlib. This information may be several years out of date,
   so needs to be verified as correct. You can help by performing research
   to validate it.
   The following stages are used to determine how much damage is absorbed
   by a piece of armour:
Base armour class
   All armour has a base armour class versus the three damage types
   (blunt, sharp and pierce). This is, very roughly, the amount of damage
   that the unaltered armour will absorb from each hit, without taking any
   other considerations into account.
   This base armour class can be determined from the vurdere command as
   follows:
   Order    Vurdere     Base AC Average Base AC
   1     Terrible       0 - 3   1.5
   2     Amazingly poor 4 - 7   5.5
   3     Pretty poor    8 - 11  9.5
   4     Poor           12 - 15 13.5
   5     OK             16 - 18 17
   6     Average        19 - 22 20.5
   7     Good           23 - 26 24.5
   8     Very good      27 - 30 28.5
   9     Extremely good 31 - 33 32
   10    Excellent      34+     37?^[1]
    1. ↑ We don't know the maximum vurdere value for excellent or even if
       there is a maximum, which makes figuring out the average rather
       difficult. The average displayed is extrapolated based on a maximum
       of 40, which makes the last step twice as large as the others.
   It is unclear if there is a way to get more accurate AC than vurdere
   value.
Enchantment
   Enchantment increases the armour class as follows:
AC = Base-AC * (1 + enchantment/max-enchantment) + enchantment
   Because the maximum enchantment is related to the weight of the item,
   this means that enchantment has a very significant effect for heavy
   armour, and a lesser effect for light armour.
   To illustrate this, see the following table detailing the AC at various
   levels of enchantment for different weights, all for items that vurdere
   as 'Extremely good':
   Weight (lb) Maximum enchantment Base AC AC (4 steady but dull enchant)
   AC (7 bright enchant) AC (10 maximum enchant - radiant)
   5 16 32 50 (6 thaums) 65 (11 thaums) 80 (16 thaums)
   10 27 32 53 (10 thaums) 71 (18 thaums) 91 (27 thaums)
   15 38 32 59 (15 thaums) 79 (26 thaums) 102 (38 thaums)
   20 50 32 63 (19 thaums) 87 (34 thaums) 114 (50 thaums)
   Note that a fully enchanted item will always more than double the base
   AC of the armour.
Effect of strength of attack
   The degree of damage absorbed by armour decreases with stronger attacks
   (as they are more able to penetrate the armour), down to a minimum
   level of half the AC.
   The specific formula is:
Damage absorbed by armour (HP) = min(damage, max(AC / 2, AC - damage/10))
   Where AC is the total AC of all pieces of armour in the location being
   hit.
   Therefore:
     * While damage is less than AC / 1.1, all damage is absorbed.
     * While damage is less than AC * 5, AC - damage / 10 is absorbed.
     * Past that, AC / 2 is absorbed.
   Our fully-enchanted 20lb armour from the table above (AC: 114) absorbs
   damage as follows:
   Damage of attack Damage absorbed by armour Damage let through

   200              94                        106                47%

   400              74                        326                19%

   500              64                        436                13%
   550              59                        491                11%
   600+             57                        543+               < 10%
   In summary:
     * While the damage is 103 or less, all damage is absorbed by the
       armour.
     * While the damage is 570 or less, 114 - damage / 10 is absorbed.
     * Past 570, 57 is absorbed.
Mechanics - Chance for armour to protect
   Mudlib-semiconf.gif This section contains formulae or data from the
   distribution mudlib. The data has been partially verified as up to
   date. You can help by filling in research on the topic.
   Armour can of course only protect the wearer if it is hit. The chance
   that an enemy will strike the body part protected by a given piece of
   armour is dependent on their tactics-focus. If they are focusing on a
   given body part, then they will always hit armour covering that part
   when their attacks are successful.
   For other focuses, the following table gives the chance that an attack
   will hit a given body area:
   Area  None-
   standard Used when the attacker is roughly the same size as you. ^[1]
   None-
   giant Used when the attacker is significantly taller than you (eg.
   giants). ^[2]  None-

Implementation
   Special abilities were added to the game on 12 April 2015, as described
   in this blog post. They boost your abilities in one area of combat, at
   the expense of another area.
   To learn an ability you need to meditate by a statue of a hero. There
   is usually some requirement to be able to learn the ability.
   To forget an ability, you need to meditate by the same statue again.
   The requirement to learn the ability must be met in order to forget the
   ability.
Locations
Ankh-Morpork
   The statue can be found southeast of the junction of Short Street,
   Heroes Street and God Street.
Sampson Ronius
(also known as)
 The Bodyguard
   Sampson requires sufficient health (hp) and the sacrifice of a shield
   (large metal worked, small and medium did not). The ability is to
   deflect damage and spend less energy when defending someone else. Only
   warriors can learn this ability.
Ephebe
   The statue can be found on the southeastern end of Hypothetical Road,
   at the junction.
Yo-lo
(also known as)
Beyond Insane
   "You can feel the voice of Yo-lo whispering secrets into your mind.
   Knowing these lessons, you will henceforth completely ignore defence to
   attack all out."
   Seems to let you use all AP (or not need any AP?) for melee,
   practically guaranteeing you can get your melee hits in against many
   opponents... however you will not even try to use any melee defence.
   You will not dodge, parry, or block. You will not somehow avoid. Every
   incoming hit will hit you/your shields/your armour. Fresh shields,
   and/or very heavy armour is recommended.
   Being shoved/tripped etc. still seems to prevent you attacking until
   you recover.
   Endorphin's Floating Friend will still block incoming hits as normal,
   and drain AP as normal, but the instant EFF drops, everything will hit
   you at once (just like when you have no AP when your EFF drops).
   Anyone can learn this ability, but it requires a minimum health value
   of around 3000 (2808 HP wasn't enough, 3000+ was). You can bypass this
   if you get enough stat boosts to push your HP up (it only cares about
   your current HP itself, not your levels in ad.health).
Sto Lat
   The statue can be found in the Sto Lat cemetery at the western edge.
Cas'leb the Merciless
   (also known as)
  The Dirty Fighter
   Requires 250 levels of fighting.unarmed.striking. The ability is to use
   knee attacks when fighting unarmed.
Genua
   The statue can be found at the junction of Genua Avenue and Dauphin
   Street.
Callus Tacticus
(also known as)
  The Focuser
   A sword needs to be sacrificed to the statue before you can acquire any
   skills. If the sword is regarded as too cheap the sacrifice will be
   rejected (e.g. a duan jian worth &&&&&&&&&&+18999 6,3,33Gf is too
   cheap, a colichemarde (from Rene's shop on Okra Avenue) worth
   &&&&&&&&&&+19998 6,6,66Gf is accepted). The ability is to be more
   effective when trying to hit a specific part of your opponent.
   Requires 150 levels of perception skill (ad.pe) and a minimum in a
   weapon(currently unknown) or 200 levels of unarmed.striking skill
   (fi.un.st)
   Syntax: <meditate by callus>
   You will get this message below if you are not high enough level by
   meditating.
   "You require a greater proficiency with a weapon or unarmed combat!
   shows when meditating at too low a level."
   If you do have enough levels it will tell you this message.
   "You feel a heavy weight on your mind, reminding you that Callus
   requires a sacrifice of a sword before teaching you how best to be a
   focuser."
   You will need to use the the syntax below first and then meditate
   after.
   Syntax: <sacrifice sword to callus>
   Replace sword if you need to specify which sword you want to sacrifice.
Djelibeybi
   The statue can be found in the front room of the Harbourmaster's
   office.
Herness Emngwey
(also known as)
The Pacifist
   Requires a minimum guild level of 200. The ability is to defend
   yourself better at the expense of not attacking, i.e. it disables
   baseround attacks and gives you some unknown defense boost. You can
   still use 'special' attacks, such as stab, pierce, impale etc.
   After testing, the "defense boost" seems to be letting you use all your
   AP for defending and no actual damage reduction or added bonus.

* Name *
Special abilities - combat bonuses in your chosen speciality
* Description *
To encourage diversity in playing styles, there are a number of "special abiliti
es". These are talents which make you better at certain areas of combat. All spe
cial abilities are passive and do not require the use of commands. There are man
y aspects of combat which have an associated special ability, for instance: defe
nding other players, fighting unarmed or using particular tactics settings.
The catch, however, is that you can only have one special ability. Once chosen,
you can easily swap your ability for another.
Your current special ability is shown in your (verbose) score.
* Learning special abilities *
At various places on Discworld, statues of ancient heroes have been placed, alon
g with a plaque describing what special ability they were renowned for.
To learn a special ability, you can meditate at the corresponding statue. By med
itating at the same statue again, you will forget the ability. Alternatively, if
 you have a special ability and meditate at a different statue, you will forget
the first and learn the new one in its place.
Not all abilities can be learned by everyone: some abilities are limited to cert
ain guilds, or require specific skills, quests or achievements before they can b
e learned.

Wimpy
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Wimpying describes an automatic or involuntary departure from a combat,
   via the "backwards" exit by default. Wimpying is usually triggered when
   a player's health has fallen below a proportion of their maximum
   hitpoints. This level is referred to as a player's wimpy. Players and
   NPCs alike can wimpy.
Contents
     * 1 Setting the wimpy level
     * 2 Operation
          + 2.1 Advantages
          + 2.2 Disadvantages
     * 3 Forcing and preventing wimpy
     * 4 See also
     * 5 External links
Setting the wimpy level
   A player can set their wimpy level either by using the 'wimpy' command,
   or through 'options combat'.
   The wimpy level can be set anywhere between 0% and 30%, and is
   displayed in the score command. If wimpy is set to zero, then this is
   displayed as being 'in brave mode'.
Operation
   Whenever a player is hit and their current hitpoints are below the
   wimpy proportion, they will immediately and automatically attempt to
   leave the room. This has advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages
     * Wimpying temporarily puts the player out of harm's way, potentially
       allowing them to escape and recover if they take further action.
     * In periods of heavy lag, an automatic wimpy may allow a player to
       escape from peril whilst they are unable to manually intervene with
       any surety.
Disadvantages
     * Wimpy can be disorienting, as it causes a sudden and unexpected
       change of location; thus, it can sometimes be worse than a less
       timely, but better planned retreat.
     * Almost all NPCs will follow players who leave the room within a
       couple of seconds, thus the reprieve is temporary at best.
     * Some NPCs or players may pursue, in which case wimpy will not
       remove the player from danger.
     * Wimpying may be fatal in and of itself if the exits are trapped,
       enemies are waiting in ambush, or the exit taken is off of a sheer
       drop.
     * If you wimpy into a room with aggressive npcs, you can end up
       wimpying back and forth between the two rooms, making it more
       difficult to run away properly (as opposed to accidentally fleeing
       to the room you just left).
     * Awarded kill XP is scaled down in proportion to the victor's wimpy
       level (so a wimpy of 10% results in 90% of the kill XP being
       awarded, for example).
     * Wimpying interrupts rituals, potentially stopping you from
       passaging away, etc., at a vital moment.
     * Wimpy ends your combat when you flee, but does not affect those who
       are fighting you. A PK who is in combat with a mix of PKs and NPCs
       will die a real death if they wimpy from a PK and are then killed
       by an NPC. A player of over a year's experience gained in a 7 year
       period died their last death after running from an aggressive NPC,
       then taking unintended PK area effect spell damage which caused him
       to wimpy back to that NPC.
Forcing and preventing wimpy
   Targets can be forced to wimpy (irrespective of their actual wimpy
   level) by:
     * Performing the Fear, Horror, or Terror rituals on them.
     * (If outside) Performing the Agoraphobia ritual on them.
     * (If in combat) Allegedly, performing the Demoralise ritual on them.
     * Casting Sorsalsean's Seismic Eruption on the room they are in.
     * Intoxicating them.
   Targets can be prevented from wimpying by:
     * A warrior guarding exits against them.
     * A witch casting vines on them.
     * Casting Myrandil's Vicious Seizure on the room they are in.
   A failure to pull something from a black top hat can result in a
   feeling of paranoia which causes occasional wimpying.

Options
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
          This article is a stub. You can help Discworld MUD Wiki by
          expanding it.
   The MUD has a large number of options, most of which you can set with
   the "options" command.
Contents
     * 1 Auto
     * 2 Colour
     * 3 Combat
     * 4 Earmuff
     * 5 Input
     * 6 Mxp
     * 7 Output
     * 8 Personal
     * 9 Terminal
Auto
   This category deals with things you can do (or try to do)
   automatically. When left off, you're asked whether you want to do them.
     * Death: There's options to allow friends or anyone to directly
       perform Raise Dead or Resurrect with no restrictions. If set to
       off, for example to prevent someone doing it without your consent,
       you'll still have the opportunity to manually accept. The possible
       concerns are that Raise Dead does not restore the experience you
       had before dying and Resurrect returns vary by the performer's
       bonus in faith.rituals.curing.target.
     * Follow: Automatically accept follow requests. You can set this
       separately for everyone, your friends, and your group.
          + Leadbehind: Turning this on means that when someone or
            something (such as a pet or minion) is following you, they
            will precede you into the room instead of coming into the room
            after you.
     * Give: Automatically let people give things to you. You can set this
       separately for everyone, your friends, and npcs.
     * Show: Automatically let people show things to you. You can set this
       separately for your friends.
     * Teach: Automatically let people learn from you with "teach me
       <skill|n/max levels of skill|command> from <living>".
Colour
   This category lets you set colours for various events. You can also use
   the "colours" command to set these.
Combat
   This category deals with combat.
     * Monitor: Lets you turn your monitor on or off, change its speed, or
       change the way it looks.
     * Tactics: This sets the same options as the tactics command.
     * Suppress_evade: With this on, you won't try to evade someone who is
       pursuing you.
     * Weapon_warning: With this on, you'll get various messages about
       things that are making you more or less effective while you're
       fighting.
     * Wimpy: Changes the percentage of hitpoints at which you'll
       automatically flee. Synonymous with the "wimpy" command.
Earmuff
   This lets you block or unblock certain events so that you don't see
   them. You can also use the "earmuff" command to set these.
     * Events: This shows you what you're earmuffing and lets you earmuff
       or stop earmuffing specific things. If you earmuff something that's
       targetted at you (like tells or remotes), then if someone tries to
       use that command on you they'll get a message that you're
       earmuffing that thing.
     * State: You can choose to have your earmuffs on or off, or on for
       everyone except your friends.
   You won't be able to do things that you're earmuffing--for example, if
   you have shout earmuffed, you won't be able to shout.
   You can earmuff shout, the newbie channel, remote-soul, multiple-soul,
   multiple-tell, teach, tell, remote and multiple-remote.
   Remote-souls are souls from people who in a different room, and the
   "multiple" things are souls, tells, or remotes that are sent to
   multiple people at once.
Input
   These options deal with the parser and let you choose the editor you
   want to use.
Mxp
   These options deal with mxp.
     * Tags: Gives you clickable links for urls, or to chat on club
       channels on the talker.
     * Enabled: Turns mxp on or off.
     * Livingmenus: When enabled, names of living things that are in the
       room with you will show up as links which you can right-click to
       see a menu of commands you can use on them.
     * Objectmenus: When enabled, object names will show up as links which
       you can right-click to see a menu of things you can do with the
       object (this doesn't necessarily include commands specific to that
       object, such as "play" for a musical instrument).
Output
   This set of options deals with the way things are displayed.
     * Map: With this, you can choose to have a small map displayed every
       time you look or glance. You can also turn off colours for maps
       with "plain", or change the map from a visual one to a written one
       with "written". (Setting written to "on" will make it tell you
       about the exits and doors you can see, how far you can see in each
       direction, and what living things you can see in surrounding rooms.
       Setting it to "doors" gives you a version that eliminates exits.)
       Finally, you can cause rooms in the visual map to be clickable
       links or not with "mxp" and--when mxp is enabled for the map--cause
       the text and background colours to be switched with
       "reversecolour".
     * Accent: "Mangle" lets you see accents, while "unadulterated" turns
       them off.
     * Asciiart: Having this "on" causes ASCII art to be shown as-is,
       whereas having it "off" causes it to be replaced with a textual
       description. The default is to have it on.
     * Combat, htell, look, names, and score can all be set to brief or
       verbose here.
     * Hints: Sometimes the game will give you hints. Having this set to
       off will hide them, while having it set to "masked" will cause it
       tell you when you got a hint without showing you the hint directly.
       (You can use "hhint" to see them.)
     * Numbers: With this set to "descriptive", various score-related
       output will give textual rather than numeric information. By
       default, it's set to "numeric".
     * Prompt: With the prompt on, you'll get a character at the beginning
       of a line when you can enter a command. You can set it to a
       specific string (for example, "options output prompt=>") or to
       "off".
     * Shorthand: ?
     * Shortinlong: With this turned on, when you "look" (or move around
       with look set to verbose), the short description of the room will
       be displayed in brackets above the long description.
     * Skills: In "branched" mode (the default), output from the "skills"
       command will display as a columned tree. In "list" mode, it will
       display as a list with the full path for each skill, then the level
       and bonus.
     * Suppress_poll: With this on, you won't get informs about new polls
       when you log in.
     * Temporal_reality: Controls whether durations (e.g. by custom item
       traders and other NPCs) are given in Roundworld or Discworld hours.
     * Usercolour: ?
     * Vote_reminder: With this on, you'll get periodic reminders to vote
       for the MUD at a voting site.
Personal
     * Description: This can be used to set your description, and have
       your description automatically start with a pronoun (or not). The
       "describe" command can also do this (as well as letting you
       describe specific zones).
     * Timezone: Lets you set your timezone relative to GMT and give it a
       name so that you can see times displayed in your local time.
     * Birthday, email, home_page, location, and real_name change these
       things as they're shown in your finger information. They can also
       be set with the "chfn" command, and email can also be set with the
       "email" command. Email specifically can be set to only be visible
       to admin and creators, by putting a colon (a ":" ) a the beginning.
     * Ignore_explain: With this set to on, people you have on ignore will
       see the reason you specified for ignoring them (if you did specify
       a reason) if they try to send you a tell.
     * Tables_opt_out: When enabled, stops you from showing up on top ten
       tables.
     * Travel: When set to "journey", you'll automatically journey (moving
       through multiple rooms at a time instead of just one) in terrains
       when this is an option. When set to "walk", you'll move one room at
       a time unless you specifically choose to "journey" in a direction.
   The old "roleplaying" option has been replaced with "roleplaying
   immersive" and "roleplaying nonimmersive", allowing a more
   mix-and-match approach to roleplaying mode.

   Your guild level is the average of your levels in all of your
   primaries.
   Guild level affects the following things:
     * Cost to godmother (this costs a life starting a level 50)
     * Whether a witch can use a taliswoman
     * XP gained from killing things
     * XP gained in groups
     * Cost of weapons permits in Bes Pelargic
     * Quota for thieves
     * Whether you can learn certain commands
     * Guild pre-titles available, and automatic post-titles
     * Whether a wizard can choose an order
     * Whether a thief is still able to choose a specialization (at level
       50, a thief who has not chosen a specialization will remain a
       Prowler permanently)
     * If you can bid on properties in Uberwald

Guild Points
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Guild points (or GP) are the equivalent of a player's energy. They are
   determined by the relevant **.points skill for your guild. Different
   guilds will use a different **.points skill to determine their overall
   GP. The **.points skills that don't determine your overall GP will
   affect how many Guild Points you may use for commands. Learnt commands
   require enough GP to be present from the relevant points skill
   associated with that command (e.g. a magic command requires
   magic.points GP). How much GP you have in each branch is viewable with
   the "GP" command.

   See Regeneration section for explanation of terms used in this table.

   Adventurers^[T 1] adventuring.points CDISW 1      1      1      1      1
    1. ↑ Whilst not an official guild, Adventurers still have primaries
       and a skill that determines their overall GP.
Regeneration
   The rate at which a player's guild points are regenerated is based on
   the player's stat points distribution (initially all stats are 13 and
   they can be changed by rearrange) and the number of each stats of the
   skill that is their primary GP skill described in the table above.
   For example, magic.points has the five stats IISWW, where I =
   intelligence, S = strength and W = wisdom, so nb_con=0, nb_dex=0,
   nb_int=2, nb_str=1, nb_wis=2.
   Specifically, the formula to calculate GP regen is:
GP regen per round = rounddown(sqrt(175/9.8 * (nb_con * ln(con) +
                                               nb_dex * ln(dex) +
                                               nb_int * ln(int) +
                                               nb_str * ln(str) +
                                               nb_wis * ln(wis)) - 43.75) - 10)
   Research indicates that there is on average one round every 2 seconds.
   Therefore:
     * 2 gp regen per round gives an average of 1 gp per second
     * 3 gp regen per round gives an average of 1.5 gp per second
     * 4 gp regen per round gives an average of 2 gp per second
Boosting guild points
   Various means exist within the game to provide an instantaneous boost
   to guild points:
     * Burying killed victims provides a small amount of GP (10 GP per
       corpse buried).
     * Energy tea can provide a substantial amount of GP as well as boost
       the maximum total, though there is a penalty when it wears off.
     * Pink crystal rings provide varying amounts of GP when twisted.
     * Stat items and other stat effects can affect the underlying stats
       for the relevant points skill. This affects both the maximum and
       the current level.
Drains and penalties
   As well as the GP cost incurred by performing commands, some other
   aspects can cause a GP drain.
     * Stat items or other stat effects (such as those produced by poison)
       can lower the maximum GP and current level, as well as potentially
       affecting the renegeneration rate.
     * Yellow stone rings consume GP at regular intervals.
     * The hide, sneak, ambush and fade commands consume small amounts of
       covert GP at regular intervals in order to keep the player in
       hiding. Furthermore, sneak consumes covert GP with each move
       between rooms, depending on sneak level.
     * The watch command consumes gp at regular intervals to keep the
       player's perception higher.
     * The player's combat attitude imparts a GP drain as follows:
   Attitude  GP drain per attack GP drain per defence
   Insane    1                   2
   Offensive 0                   1
   Neutral   0                   0
   Defensive 1                   0
   Wimp      2                   1

Heartbeat
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
          This article is a stub. You can help Discworld MUD Wiki by
          expanding it.
   One heartbeat is generally two seconds. However, it's said to vary
   sometimes with lag.
Heartbeat-based effects
   There are a few things that happen on each heartbeat:
     * You get a small amount of xp, known as "heartbeat xp". This starts
       at 3 xp per heartbeat and is decreased as your xp rate gets above
       500,000 xp per hour.
     * If injured, you will also--usually--regenerate a small number of
       hp. The exact number depends on your constitution and strength,
       varying from 2 to 6 within the range of possible unmodified stats,
       with 4 being the rate that all 13's gives you. With very damaged
       stats, you may have a regeneration rate of 0.
     * If you have less than full gp, you will regenerate a small number
       of gp. The exact number depends on your guild and stats (the
       specific stats it depends on varies with guild). Natural
       regeneration rates vary from 1 to 4, with 3 being the rate that all
       13's gives you. With very damaged stats, you may have a
       regeneration rate of 0.
     * If you have less than full social points, you regenerate one.
   Oddly enough, being dead doesn't seem to stop your heartbeat, as your
   xp and gp still increase while you are a ghost (however, this is only
   visible with certain clients or plugins that can update from mxp, since
   being dead means you cannot view your score).
   Apparently, having a heartbeat is required in order to take part in
   fights.
   Some effects, such as Major Shield, seem to have a duration measured in
   heartbeats.
Restarting your heartbeat
   The "restart" command restarts your heartbeat if it is stopped by a
   bug.
     * Discworld command help: restart

Raise & Resurrect
   As long as you still have some lives in reserve, you can be raised or
   resurrected as below.
     * Note that you must wait for DEATH to finish his speech before you
       can be raised or resurrected.
   Otherwise nothing short of the Rite of AshkEnte will allow you to be
   corporeal again.
Raise Dead ritual
   Raise Dead is a ritual granted by Gufnork, Pishe and Sek. It is also
   available through some NPCs and in some special rooms, usually
   requiring some interaction by the ghost, such as using the command
   "raise" or saying "please raise me". I don't know if any of the NPCs
   are language sensitive. It will restore the ghostly player to a more
   substantial form, albeit with a reduced constitution stat, no XP other
   than that gained while dead, and very low HP. This is the same as being
   raised in the shrines and temples listed below.
   The Restore ritual can fix their constitution stat afterwards.
Resurrect ritual
   Resurrect is a ritual granted by Pishe. The advantages of resurrect is
   that it can restore some of the lost XP and will also restore player
   stats, but it will not restore HP.
   Resurrect needs a lot of energy (GP) to cast, and even high level
   Priests and Priestesses can fail. They will then have to wait for their
   GP to build up before trying again. Most Priests and Priestesses do not
   appreciate funny stunts while waiting, and the best advice if this
   occurs is to "keep your hands away from the keyboard and wait
   patiently". Your funny stunt may be perceived as complaining about
   ritual failure (see above) which may lead to you receiving a reduced
   service. This might be, but is not limited to: raise dead instead of
   resurrect, no healing after raising / resurrection, no restore after a
   raise, or the pishite just leaving.
   The percentage of XP return seems to be based on the
   faith.rituals.curing.target bonus of the priest doing the resurrection,
   and any ritual modifiers. The return to the resurrected person seems to
   be capped at 75% of their pre-death XP. Note, however, that this only
   applies to the xp they had when they died. Any xp accumulated while
   dead is returned in full.
   A pishite will not necessarily be able to tell you what your XP return
   will be. However, unless you had little xp on you when you died, it
   makes sense to look for the highest resurrection bonus you can. The
   skills website and the "who pishe" or "who RRU" command may help. Note,
   however, that ghosts asking Pishites for their bonuses at their moment
   of need may alienate those Pishites.
   See also the ritual information for Resurrect.
Getting Resurrected
   There are people who will try and help you.
     * These are generally Pishites, who are granted the ritual resurrect.
     * There are a small but slowly increasing number of non Pishites and
       even non Priests who can also resurrect using faith rods.
     * See resurrect alts for a list of characters who have an alt that
       can resurrect.
   You should:
     * Be Polite, we did not kill you, we are trying to help you.
     * Understand that immediately and now are relative, and may depend on
       your rescuers ability to first lead any groupmates to a safe area
       and then travel half way across the disc.
     * Warn rescuers of any specific hazards, like Yetis or Spiders in the
       room with your corpse. If it killed you, it may present a hazard to
       us too, we're not all big tough fighters like you were before you
       died.
     * Show appreciation. This need not be financial, but your attitude
       may affect the response next time you need assistance.
     * Remember that in terrains, the easiest way for us to find you is by
       using "Find Corpse", so staying with your corpse helps. Staying in
       the room with your corpse may also be the only thing that stops the
       room from unloading (and taking your former inventory with it) if
       your corpse decays (particularly if there are no living things in
       the room with it).^[1]
     * Be specific about where you are, if you can. If you're in a city,
       the name of the street you're on is helpful (although some streets,
       like Endless Street or Long Street, are large enough that more
       information may be necessary). If you're in a building, tell us. If
       you're in a hidden area^[2], be clear about that--not everyone
       knows about all of those.
     * Stay Still while being resurrected, if you walk away during the
       ritual, the priest will waste 3 minutes of gp regeneration on a
       failed ritual! Unfollow your groupmates if they might move.
   You should not, under any circumstances, complain about:
     * Response time.
     * Delays waiting for GP regeneration.
     * Failure to Raise / Resurrect / Restore.
     * Inability to retrieve heavy items from your drowned corpse.
     * The unwillingness of rescuers to die whilst retrieving your
       equipment.
     * Less XP return than you expected.
   If the ritual failed, sit tight and wait quietly unless the priest says
   otherwise.
     * A priest that has just failed a ressurect or raise ritual probably
       feels upset enough about it without you doing or saying anything at
       all.
     * GP regen is normally required before the ritual can be repeated.
     * We didn't kill you, we're trying to help. Please don't get annoyed
       at us!
   After resurrection, preferably after getting healed, the following
   commands will be helpful:
          get all from <name> corpse where <name> is your simple character
          name, and
          equip which should be done quickly so that you don't fumble
          items.
   Please note that if you have, for example, magic scrolls on your
   corpse, it can be hazardous and even fatal to get your inventory before
   you have been healed.
     * Players have died their final death doing this.
     * Even a single scroll skillcheck can be failed by an experienced
       wizard! Wait until you have been healed.
     * The same applies to, eg, getting and equipping poniards.
   It would also be a good idea to warn the pishite in advance if there
   are npcs likely to attack you after you are resurrected, eg Hitmen or
   City Guards in Genua, Royal Guards in Sto Lat, etc.
     * They may be able to take action to minimise the risk to you of
       dying immediately to such an attack, such as resurrecting you in a
       passage room.
Points to Remember
   Remember that after both Resurrect and Raise you will need some healing
   before you do anything that may cause a loss of HP. After Raise you
   will also need a Restore or to wait for your Con stat to increase to
   its normal level. Shrines, Temples etc.
RRU
   "What about my expensive equipment?" you ask.
   There is a club called RRU who generally try and help people who have
   died in difficult to reach or hazardous locations, however the help
   they can give is obviously limited to suitably skilled people being
   logged on at the right time. If the only RRU member logged in is a weak
   Pishite with a moderate healing bonus, don't expect them to pull your
   corpse out of the snail, climb to the hub and resurrect you, or swim to
   the bottom of the circle sea.
   Finally, if it's that valuable, you're in an impossible to reach or
   extremely dangerous area, and you had a spare life, then consider the
   use of godmother (see below).
   RRU have their own website but it is out of date.
NPC Raise Dead Locations
   These are locations where a ghostly player may be restored to a more
   substantial form without player assistance. In all cases, the restored
   player will have reduced stats. You may need to use a command (such as
   "raise") or request the help of NPC ("say please raise me" or "sayto
   <npc> please raise me"), and some of the NPCs may be language
   sensitive. The known locations are:
   Area Location Npc What to do More information
   Ankh-Morpork Temple of Small Gods, small chapel Harry say raise 4
   South, 4 West and North from the carriage stop outside the temple.
   Djelibeybi Temple of Sessifet, tiny chapel Ptamney (just enter the
   room) It takes only seconds. The temple of Sessifet is a safe zone,
   your health and gp will not regenerate there.
   Ephebe Outside the taverna on Flatulus Walk, sw of the Harbour Market
   Himaclitus sit beside Himaclitus;listen to Himaclitus (answer yes or
   nod to the final question) You can pretend to understand the lesson
   that Himaclitus tries to teach you by nodding at him at the right time.
   Bes Pelargic Curative place, northeast end of BP Tu Silent Llamas (just
   enter the room) It takes only seconds. Extreme northeast of BP, West

   the track to the Temple of Soyin. Watch out for Yetis and Lynxes that
   will pursue you (while alive, for example after being raised in the
   shrine).

   southeast of the path leading to the Magpyr castle.
   Netherworld (say misty) Misty ? Note that priests cannot perform
   rituals in the Netherworld, and the exit guardian will stop people from
   leaving whether or not they are ghosts. You cannot cast either.
Godmother
   The NPC of last resort, the Godmother will transfer you to your start
   location, raise you and (as long as you request her help in the same
   room as your corpse is in) bring your body along as well, but she will
   charge, initially just a temporary stat drop, later on she charges a
   life. Make sure you have a spare life before using the godmother
   command. If you are having problems understanding or communicating with
   the good fairy, just "say yes", "nod" your head and "think yes".
   If aggressive NPCs are attacking the godmother, or she's drowning when
   you summon her, just use "think yes" after she appears, and usually
   that will do the trick.
   Note that if an aggressive NPC attacks and kills the godmother when you
   summon her, the NPC should be bugrepped for attacking the godmother.
Other Useful Information
Your Corpse and Inventory
   Upon death, everything on you will be on your corpse, except pets,
   which will remain in your arms. Your corpse will decompose over the
   course of an hour, and will continue to do so even after you've logged
   off. When it finishes, any items that were on it (your former
   inventory) will be left on the floor. Items on the floor can be lost if
   someone picks them up, or if the room unloads, so it's a good idea to
   get your stuff as soon as possible and not log off while dead.
   Getting your inventory off your corpse can be almost as problematic for
   the newbie as sorting out their first resurrection. Here is a useful
   alias, it assumes a player's name is bob.
   alias aliveagain get all from bob corpses;equip;get all from bob
   corpses;equip;get all from bob corpses;equip;get flowers;braid them in
   my hair
   This alias will recover your inventory from your corpse when you are in
   the same room as it, and equip all worn or held items that it can from
   that inventory, which should prevent fumbling due to an excessive
   inventory count.
   There's 3 get all because you can have up to 50 things in your
   inventory, plus money which counts as one when picking up.
   Simply return to the room with your corpse and use the command
   "aliveagain".
   Remember to wait until you've been fully healed to do this--see the
   previous note about scrolls and other potentially damaging items.
New Lives
   You have a number of deaths remaining until your final death. However,
   you can buy more lives, so dying can be merely expensive rather than,
   um, fatal.
Your Opponents
   If you died in combat, your opponents will stop fighting you. That is,
   once you're raised or resurrected and are in the same room as they are,
   they won't attack you. This doesn't apply to NPCs who are aggressive in
   the first place, such as crocodiles.
Final Death
   When you have died and have no more lives left, your death will be
   notified to players around the MUD.
   What it looks like when you have died for the last time:
You have died your final death. Your name will be inscribed in the Hall of Legen
ds.
Aristotle has died for the last time. He is mourned.
An Igor walks up to the corpse of Aristotle and quickly strips all the items fro
m it before walking off with them.
   If a Pishe priest or any other priest tries to resurrect you, they will
   see this message:
Death tells you: NO, THIS TIME HE IS COMPLETELY DEAD.
   The only way to return to corporeality is if other players complete the
   Rite of AshkEnte.
     * This is very expensive and time consuming.
     * You lose all money and most items.
     * Your skills are cut.
Footnotes
    1. ↑ If you ran off and aren't sure exactly where your corpse is now,
       you have a couple of options. First, you can use "history" or your
       scrollback to help retrace your steps. Second, you can check the
       ascii map--this shows where living things are, so sometimes it can
       give you a rough idea of the path you took (and if you were killed
       by a living thing, it's likely still in the room). If you died
       underwater, remember that corpses sink to the bottom.
    2. ↑ Somewhere you get to through a non-obvious exit, or somewhere
       where you have to do something to make the exit visible.

Buying lives
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Two of the most common questions on the talker and the newbie channel
   are "I'm dead, what next?" and "How do I buy more lives?". This page
   seeks to address the second of these questions.
   You start with 7 lives for free without having to do anything. Hurray!
   You can check this with the score command.
   There are several methods to buy new lives: tossing royals to Pishe at
   her pool in her waterpark in Ankh-Morpork, tossing money in Pishe's
   pool in Lancre or through the Golden Chicken in Bes Pelargic.
   Offering money to Pishe is reliable & straightforward but expensive,
   while the egg process, while potentially cheaper, takes more time and
   it can fail for several reasons even if you do everything you can.

Pishe's Temple (Ankh Morpork)
Where
   At Pishe's Pool, which is located in the Temple of Pishe, in the
   Apothecary Gardens, in Ankh Morpork.
   Directions from outside The Mended Drum:
   4 west, 5 north (crossing Contract Bridge), west, north, northwest, 2
   north, 4 northeast, northwest, north, northeast, 2 northwest, north, 2
   northwest (crossing Lost Bridge), north, 2 northwest, southwest (into

   Note - entering the temple costs 1p per guild level except for
   adventurers, ghosts and Pishites.
   The "Slide of restoration" is found from life pool: southeast, up
Help file
   Part of help file in room with "Slide of restoration":
    Buying Lives
    Lives can now be purchased in the natural rock pool northwest of the main en
trance to the
    Pishe Gardens.  To see how to do this, use 'syntax toss' while in the room.
 Lives are
    slightly cheaper for priests of Pishe.
    Note that you need to be at full strength to buy lives.  There is a means, s
omewhere in
    the garden, to restore yourself to your full ability.
How
   You buy lives by tossing royals into the pool. The syntax is:
toss <1 royal / n royals> into pool
   Most people toss a single royal at a time, until they receive a life.
   This is indicated with a message such as:
   Saving...
   You feel like you have more life.
   Pishe smiles on you and lifts the clouds from your heart, but the
   moment has been draining. Some rest will probably help.
   The pool seems to have some memory and will remember for a time, no-one
   knows how long it seems, if you have to go away and get more royals
   part way through the process. However, most people prefer to make sure
   they bring plenty with them.
Cost
   It varies. Random numbers, the phases of the moon, your guild level,
   how long since you last bought a life? Who knows (apart from the
   Cre's)? The following are based on my own perception:
     * It seems to get more expensive with each life.
     * It seems to be roughly Number of Lives Bought so far, divided by 5,
       in royals, with fluctuations of about 20% either side.
     * It might be cheaper if you allow a bit of time between buying
       lives.
     * The cheapest solution is to not die.
     * It's cheaper for Pishites.
   ...or... you could consider Sined's calculation. Archived copy :
   https://dwwiki.mooo.com/sined/priest/newlifes.htm
     * Number of Deaths so far, or Number of Lives Bought so far, divided
       by 5, in royals, +-20%.
   You can calculate these minimum and maximum with the following
   equations:
math NUMBER / 5 * 0.8
math NUMBER / 5 * 1.2
   Replace NUMBER with your deaths, the number after You have died in
   score.
     * Alternatively, if you want to calculate your lives bought so far :
       deaths + times you can die in score - 7 (initial number of lives)
Warning
   Remember that message above? Where it said "But the moment has been
   draining. Some rest will probably help." .... it wasn't kidding. Your
   constitution stat has dropped several levels. It will come back up over
   time, or with a "restore" ritual from a Pishe priest. (You can also get
   a restore by sliding down the slide in the tree, see below section)
   Your con stat is the largest part of your HP, so you have low HP after
   this. In addition, you may not have enough con to buy another life
   straight away. If you try, this happens:
You consider tossing one Ankh-Morpork royal into the pool, but decide to wait an
d get your strength back first.
Slide of restoration
   Remember to pay respects to Pishe or else you will hurt yourself
   sliding down a dry slide
   You will need at least 20 dollars to pay respects
 pay respects to Pishe
 You place some coins in the rain cloud above the slide.  The cloud darkens slig
htly, as though heavy with rain.
 slide down [water] slide {sitting|headfirst}
 Heavy raindrops start to fall from the cloud and pour down the slide.
 You cautiously sit on the top of the slide before gathering the courage to let
go.
 The water rushing around you quickly propels you downwards to the pool below.
 As the restorative water rushing down the slide engulfs you, you feel your heal
th return to you.
 As your journey down the slide comes to a finish you fly off the end and splash
 into the water of the pool.
   There is a adventuring.acrobatics.balancing skillcheck for this and you
   don't get the restore if you fail it.
   Without paying respects, you get hurt sliding down (about 50 hp).
You run up and leap onto the slide, realising too late that there is no water on
 it!
You painfully make your way down, exposed skin being scraped cruely by the dry w
ood.
Finally you reach the end of your journey and fall into the pool with a splash.
Pishe's Pool (Lancre)
   You can also buy lives at the pool of Pishe's Temple in Lancre Kingdom,
   a few miles north of Lancre Town.
Where
   From Lancre Town, journey northeast, then journey north from the
   intersection, then journey west from the intersection, then go south
   four times. The room also contains a Pishe high altar, and there is a
   hut with a Pishite religious instructor just east of it.
How
   The pool accepts donations of Lancre sovereigns (and larger
   denominations of Lancrastian currency) and as a basic calculation, two
   sovereigns are roughly equivalent to one royal. The pool responds to
   "syntax offer".
   If you donate smaller denominations of Lancre currency, you may receive
   healing if you are in need of it, but it is not known if such donations
   are also credited towards a life or not.
   There does not seem to be any link between the two locations, in that
   money offered at either for a life does not count towards the cost at
   the other one.
   This pool also appears to remember partial donations, like the
   Ankh-Morpork one the duration of such memories is unknown.
   The caveats about your constitution dropping apply here as well.
Golden chicken
   In Bes Pelargic there is a Golden Chicken that wanders randomly. If you
   feed it enough chicken logs (purchased from a stall in the High Tide
   Road covered market) it can then be squeezed to lay an egg. If you then
   follow the egg around hugging, kissing, and cuddling it, it eventually
   hatches and you gain a life. If the egg is not catered to promptly and
   consistently, it breaks and is lost.
   Typically it takes between 5 and 12 logs to get the chicken completely
   stuffed so it can lay an egg. The logs cost &&&&&&&&&&&+4000 8Rh 40s
   each, so this is usually much cheaper than buying lives from Pishe (and
   there is no stat reduction when using this method). However, it is much
   more time consuming and there is no guarantee it will be successful
   (e.g. the egg might roll into water and die, through no fault of and
   with no recourse for the player).
   Success looks like this:
Belias's egg wobbles.
Belias's egg wobbles alarmingly.
Belias's egg wobbles slightly.
A small crack appears on the surface of Belias's egg, which grows and spreads.
Suddenly, the shell explodes in a burst of flame and vanishes, a bird-like
form flying upwards out of the blast. The fiery bird spreads its wings and
silently dissipates.
You feel curiously full of vitality and life.
   Failure can look like this:
Sorae's egg wobbles sadly.
Sorae's egg dies.
A small crack appears on the surface of Sorae's egg, which grows and spreads unt
il finally the entire shell collapses, yolk and egg white pouring everywhere fro
m within.
With a sense of terrible sadness, you realise that your egg has tragically peris
hed, the wonderful life within that could have been, no more.
   At the beginning, it takes 20 to 30 minutes of chasing and pandering to
   the egg before it hatches. This time will increase as the number of
   lives you've successfully chased increases. At around 120 lives
   successfully chased, the time before the egg hatches is around 70
   minutes.
   The egg moves 7 to 11 rooms at a time, after each interaction where you
   either hug, cuddle or kiss it. It appears to pick the direction
   randomly from any exit in the room, visible or not (with a bias against
   going back the way it just came). It will enter stores, playerhouses
   and family estates.
   The egg can be successfully trapped in a playerhouse for the duration
   of the chase if it wanders in and the playerhouse is locked in time,
   but it can not be a one room house. The egg has to be able to roll
   around, even if it's only back and forth in a two room house.
   It is unclear if it can be pursued successfully with the pursue command
   - it seems to easily evade pursuit with low to moderate bonuses, at
   least.
   Warriors are able to track the scent of the egg, though more research
   may have to be done to confirm how well the tracking works.
track egg
You inspect your surroundings and have few doubts that Ownerless egg went east j
ust moments ago.
   It can be prevented from using an exit with guard, but this makes it
   unhappy and risks it breaking. This is still worth doing, however, for
   exits that will be fatal to the egg (e.g. entrances to waterways).
   The egg does not show up through map door text, making it harder to
   track than normal NPCs.
   The best places to work with the egg are large open spaces, such as
   Dragon Head Square or the Square of a Thousand Parades. The movement of
   the egg in nearby rooms will be shown, making it easier to follow its
   rapid movement, and these locations have no natural hazards that can
   kill the egg (such as water). There is little you can do to control the
   location in general, but if the chicken or egg are already near these
   locations, use of guard (or similar) can herd them in the right
   direction.

Shield
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
          For a discussion on shield mechanics, see Block and Armour.
          For the page on magic shields, see Shields.
   This page presents the information available on holdable shield
   objects.
   For the list of pages about shields see Category:Shields.
   Shields are used in the Discworld MUD to actively block attacks (when
   held) and to passively protect like armour at the same time. They are
   also floaters used with the wizard spell Endorphin's Floating Friend.
   The bigger the shield is the more areas it will cover and thus protect
   passively like armour but it will be heavier.
   The better the material is the more damage it will absorb. The better
   materials tend to weigh more than worse ones, making very good shields
   increase burden alarmingly. See Ug Ogg to see how material and weight
   are related to protection for custom armours (this should be indicative
   of normal items too).
   The learnable Vurdere command can be used to assess the quality of a
   shield (judge is used for weapons).
   Shields can be obtained from shops or from NPCs. Custom shields can
   also be ordered from Ug Ogg. See Ug Ogg Shields.
   There are three custom shield types which have identical
   characteristics: buckler^[1], aegis shield^[2] and wall shield (only
   available in large size).

   Weapons are, for almost all players, a necessity of every-day life on
   the Disc. Players rely on their weapons to do physical damage to
   enemies and, if parrying, to defend themselves. There are a great
   variety of weapons on the Disc, suited to varying levels of proficiency
   and bloodthirstiness.

General information
   Weapons are used in the Discworld MUD to (typically) kill things. Most
   are melee-oriented, but many are well suited to throwing. Certain
   weapons such as the crossbow and blowpipe are available in game but are
   of extremely limited use to non-Assassins.
   Weapons can be found in shops, or in the possession of players and
   NPCs. Certain weapons can only be acquired by completing Quests; those
   weapons are detailed here, but the means of getting them are not.
   The Judge command can be used to assess the quality of a weapon
   (vurdere is used for armour). Note, however, that this command is only
   available after the player has 5 levels of the skill
   adventuring.evaluating.weapons.
   Some weapons can be used as melee as well as ranged weapons.
   Any object can also be thrown at targets, but such objects are likely
   to be less effective than throwing weapons designed for such an attack.
Weapon tables
   You can find tables with all individual weapons per type in the
   following pages:
          Melee ~ Axes | Daggers | Flails | Heavy-swords | Misc weapons |
          Polearms | Swords | Maces ~ Unarmed
          Ranged ~ Fired | Thrown - Info: Weapons wanted example -
          Protection: < Shields wanted example > < Armours wanted example
          > < Scabbards >
Categories
   Weapons on the disc are divided into the following categories, each
   with its own skill associated with it.
   Most weapons are melee weapons, that can be used in close combat
   without using projectiles.
   Weapon type Skill Description Examples
   Daggers fighting.melee.dagger Any short, bladed weapon. They are light
   and fast; they sacrifice damage for speed and covert utility. Elegant
   stiletto, Aikuchi dagger.
   Swords fighting.melee.sword A weapon with a long blade, between the
   shorter daggers and the longer and heavier heavy-swords. Katana, Fine
   sabre.
   Heavy-swords fighting.melee.heavy-sword A big, heavy bladed weapon,
   usually requiring both hands to lift and slow to move. Sarilak,
   Nodachi.
   Axes fighting.melee.axe A weapon with a cutting edge at the end of a
   short shaft. Meridian axe, Axe of Managerial Ire.
   Maces fighting.melee.mace A rigid weapon with a blunt end. This class
   also includes hammers. Retribution, Crowbar
   Flails fighting.melee.flail A staff with swinging parts attached to one
   end via a chain. Morning star, War flail.
   Polearms fighting.melee.polearm A weapon including a long pole, which
   may or may not have something attached at one or both ends. Broomstick,
   Knight's halberd.
   Misc fighting.melee.misc Any melee weapon that doesn't fit into the
   above categories. Rubber chicken, Ukulele of pain.
   Items can also be ranged weapons, sometimes in addition to being melee
   weapons.
   Ranged weapons are divided into the following categories:
   Weapon type Skill Description Examples
   Thrown fighting.range.thrown Any weapon designed to be thrown by hand
   without more specialized launching methods at an opponent. Throwing
   knife, Throwing khyber.
   Fired fighting.range.fired Any weapon which propels a projectile at a
   target, amplifying the damage caused. Ivory blowpipe, Hand crossbow.
   The type of a weapon can be seen by appraising it.
Attacks
   Each weapon has one or more 'attacks' that may be used when a player
   strikes with it; each 'attack' has the following associated with it.
     * The type of damage (blunt, sharp, piercing or fire) - this
       determines which variety of armour class is used when the weapon
       strikes armour, and also determines which special attacks the
       weapon has associated with it. Fire damage ignores armour for the
       most part, taking several layers of it to make any difference. It
       may be that metal armour is treated differently than other types in
       regards to fire damage.  research If this has been marked on a
       page, it's because there was something that probably isn't known,
       that the person who edited the page thinks could be found out.
       Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be famous evermore.
     * A difficulty rating - this determines how hard it is to perform
       that attack.
     * A base damage characteristic - this is the distribution of damage
       caused by that attack, before any other modifiers (such as the
       player's skills) are applied.
   For example, a long sword might have two attacks associated with it -
   slashing at someone and stabbing them with the point. The former attack
   does slashing damage, and is easier than the latter to do. The latter
   attack does piercing damage and, although harder to do, causes more
   damage.
   It should be noted that although weapons may have multiple attacks
   associated with them, only one attack is used per strike - a weapon
   with 10 attacks does not strike any more often than one with a single
   attack. Multiple attacks only serve to add variety to the weapon's
   damage, they do not make it hit any faster.
   There is no way for a player to specifically view the attacks
   associated with a weapon, though the presence of multiple attacks could
   be inferred by observing the attack messages produced by the weapon
   over a while, thereby deducing the types of the attacks observed (eg.
   pierce and blunt). It should be kept in mind that there can be several
   attacks of the same type with different characteristics (average and
   maximum damage, chance to hit, etc.) produced by the same weapon.
Special attacks
   Each weapon may have any number of special attacks associated with it;
   the list of special attacks is revealed on successful use of the judge
   command, but only for the special attacks known to the one using judge.
   Special attacks are attacks which require guild points to perform and
   consume additional action points, but can cause much more damage than a
   normal attack would.
Damaged weapons
   As weapons are used to attack or parry, they become damaged and lose
   condition. This negatively affects the damage that weapon can deal out,
   therefore it is important to keep weapons in good condition. Weapons
   can be fixed in a location appropriate to the material they are made
   out of - metal weapons (most weapons are made of metal) are fixed in a
   smithy, leather ones (such as whips) are leatherworked in a tannery,
   and wooden weapons (staves and broomsticks) are repaired in a
   woodworking shop.
Scabbards
   Due to their shape, many weapons do not fit well into standard
   containers (such as backpacks). To that end, players can sheathe their
   weapons in scabbards when they are not using them.
Magical weapons
   Some weapons have magical effects associated with them. These can be
   divided into two categories:
     * Weapons that serve a magical purpose, but don't automatically cause
       magical damage when fighting. Examples include broomsticks and red
       staves.
     * Weapons that do (or have a chance to do) magical damage with each
       hit. Examples include:
          + Sarilak - sprays acid on striking.
          + Ornate warhammer - poisons on striking.
Mechanics - To hit
   The chance to hit an opponent with a weapon is a long and complex
   calculation. In terms of factors directly affected by the attacker's
   weapon(s), the following sections apply. Note that there are many other
   factors at play - for example, the opponent's dodge and/or parry
   prowess, how bright the room is, whether the attacker is low on
   fighting GP, and so on.
Attack selection and difficulty
   As indicated above, each weapon may have multiple attacks associated
   with it, and each attack has an an inherent difficulty rating.
   When a player attempts an attack with a weapon, they are given a score
   as a random number. This score is then modified as follows:
     * It is increased by the attacker's strength stat.
     * It is increased by the attacker's dexterity stat.
     * It is decreased by 4.5x the weapon's weight (in lb).
   The score is then compared against the difficulty rating for each
   attack. Any attacks that have a higher difficulty rating^[1] than the
   score are discarded, and an attack is randomly chosen from the
   remainder. If no attacks remain, then the attacker will fail to do
   anything for that combat round.
Weapon encumberance
   The to-hit chance is affected negatively by the weapon's encumberance,
   that is, how hard it is to swing it around. Specifically:
     * There is a to-hit penalty proportional to the weapon's weight.
     * If the player is holding multiple items, then there is a to-hit
       penalty based on the weight of the other held items.
          + This penalty is reduced a lot if the item in question is a
            shield.
          + This penalty is reduced if the player's tactics-response isn't
            parry - as long as the total weight of the other items is less
            than dexterity/9 lb.
     * The weight penalty is decreased by 33% if the player is wielding
       the weapon in both hands.
     * The weight penalty is reduced by an amount proportional to the
       player's strength.
Attacking with the off-hand
   If the attacker is attacking with a weapon held in their off-hand^[2],
   then you need additional skill to wield it without penalty.
   Specifically, you will incur a penalty if attacking with the off-hand
   and your dexterity is less than 14, with the penalty proportional to
   (14 - dexterity).
Skills
   The attacker gets a to-hit bonus in proportion to the weapon skill
   appropriate to their weapon (see the categories section above).
Mechanics - Action point cost
   The action point cost of an attack determines, to a certain extent, how
   many attacks a player can make in a combat round. The following
   sections detail how this cost is calculated.
Weapon encumberance (round 2)
   Not only does weapon encumberance affect the chance to hit, but it also
   affects the AP cost of an attack - a more cumbersome weapon takes
   longer to attack with than a lighter one does. Weapon encumberance has
   the following action point effects:
     * The action point cost is increased by the 9x the square root of the
       weapon's weight (in lb).
     * This cost is reduced by 33% if the weapon is held in both hands.
     * If the attacker if wielding two weapons, then the action point cost
       is reduced by a small, constant amount (as you can use one to
       counterbalance the other).
Skills
   The attacker's skills affect the action point cost as follows:
     * The AP cost is reduced by an amount proportional to the attacker's
       bonus in the weapon skill appropriate to the weapon being used (see
       the categories section above).
     * The AP cost is reduced by an amount proportional to the attacker's
       fighting.special.tactics bonus.
Caps
   The action point cost for attacking has both maximum and minimum caps:
     * It is capped at below 2x the 'base AP cost'
     * It is capped at above 1/5 the 'base AP cost'
   Therefore there are certain limits beyond which it is impossible to
   make a weapon attack any faster (or any slower).
Mechanics - Damage
Base damage
   The damage calculation for a weapon starts with the weapon's base
   damage. This is essentially a representation of how good the weapon is
   on its own, before any other factors have been taken into account.
   The base damage of a weapon may be categorized by a minimum, average
   and maximum damage caused by that weapon. Weapons may fall into one of
   three categories as far as base damage is concerned:
     * Constant damage: These weapons always do exactly the same amount of
       base damage - thus, their minimum, average and maximum are the
       same.
     * Flat variable damage: These weapons may do anywhere between their
       minimum and maximum base damage, with an equal chance of a given
       hit being anywhere inbetween the two.
     * Binomial variable damage: These weapons may do anywhere between
       their minimum and maximum base damage, but a given hit is more
       likely to occur at a damage level around the average than towards
       the extremes.
   You can derive a rough assessment of a weapon's average and maximum
   damage using the judge command.
Why should I care about the maximum damage?
   Generally speaking, the average is the most important in terms of total
   damage dealt over time. However, the maximum damage becomes relevant if
   you're attacking an armoured opponent, or one who otherwise has
   protection which removes a roughly constant amount from attacks.
   The reason for this is hard to explain, but easy to demonstrate.
   Essentially, a more variable weapon is more useful against armour
   because a lesser proportion of damage is removed from the 'big hits',
   and those have a bigger impact on the total damage dealt.
   To illustrate this, consider the following example. A target wearing
   armour is hit by two weapons, both with the same average damage:
     * Weapon 1 does a constant 150hp damage per hit.
     * Weapon 2 does between 50 and 250 damage per hit.
   The armour absorbs 100hp from each strike.
   Let us simulate 10 hits from weapon 1:
   Attack                     1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  Total
   Attack damage              150 150 150 150 150 150 150 150 150 150 1500
   Damage absorbed by armour  100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 1000
   Damage inflicted on victim 50  50  50  50  50  50  50  50  50  50  500
   And now 10 hits from weapon 2:
   Attack                     1   2  3   4  5   6   7   8   9   10  Total
   Attack damage              100 60 170 70 150 230 240 230 110 140 1500
   Damage absorbed by armour  100 60 100 70 100 100 100 100 100 100 930
   Damage inflicted on victim 0   0  70  0  50  130 140 130 10  40  570
   As can be seen, the more variable weapon had the same total base damage
   before armour, but more of it got through.
   While the above examples illustrate the point by assuming a constant
   amount of damage reduction, it should also be noted that past certain
   thesholds of damage dealt (relative to the AC of the location being
   damaged), AC is less effective. If the damage reduction in the examples
   had been entirely provided by AC, the actual total damage that would
   have gotten through in example 2 would have been 592 instead of 570.
Enchantment and condition
   After the base damage has been determined, the effects of enchantment
   and condition are factored in as follows:
   Enchantment
   Enchantment increases the damage caused by a weapon, via the following
   formula:
Extra damage = base_damage * (%enchant)/(100 + %enchant)
   So, a fully enchanted weapon will do 50% more damage; a 50% enchanted
   weapon will do 33% more damage. Note that the absolute amount of
   enchantment in thaums on the weapon is irrelevant as far as damage goes
   - only the percentage of the maximum enchantment level for that item
   matters.
   Condition
   A weapon does damage in proportion to its condition - so a heavily
   damaged weapon will do very little damage. The following formula is
   applied:
Damage = pre_condition_damage * (condition / max_condition)
   So, a weapon that is at 50% condition will only do 50% damage, one at
   25% condition does 25% damage, and so on.
Effect of skills
   The weapon's damage is then combined with the relevant weapon bonus (as
   per the categories section above) in a geometric average to get the
   final weapon damage. Specifically, the following formula applies:
Total weapon damage = sqrt(damage * skill_bonus)
   The total damage is capped at thrice the post-condition-and-enchantment
   damage; therefore insane skills for a puny weapon will not produce a
   particularly high damage.
   Note that the consequence of the above formula is that increasing
   whichever is the lesser of the post-enchantment damage and the skill
   bonus has a bigger effect. To illustrate this, consider two examples:
     * In the first example, we have a novice player with a 100 sword
       bonus, wielding a 150 base damage unenchanted sword. Their final
       average damage is 122. If they were to fully enchant their sword
       (increase the post-enchant damage by 75), then their final average
       damage would be 150. In order to get the same damage without
       enchanting their weapon, they would need to advance their sword
       skill until they had a bonus of 150 (increase bonus by 50).
     * In the second example, we have a reasonably skilled player with 400
       sword bonus, wielding a 150 base damage unenchanted sword. Their
       final average damage is 245. If they were to fully enchant their
       sword (increase the post-enchant damage by 75), then their final
       average damage would be 300. In order to get the same damage
       without enchanting their weapon, they would have to advance their
       sword skill until they had a bonus of 600 (increase bonus by 200).
Critical and marginal hits
   The damage can be further modified by the the degree to which the
   attacker won the earlier to-hit calculation:
     * If the attacker succeeded their to-hit check by an extremely large
       margin, then their final damage is doubled.
     * If the attacker succeeded their to-hit check by a very large
       margin, then their final damage is multiplied by 1.5.^[3]
     * If the attacker only just succeeded in their to-hit check, then
       their final damage is halved.
Damage inflicted
   So is the final damage, as determined above, that which ends up getting
   inflicted on the victim? Not necessarily. The figure as determined
   above is the total damage that is caused before any defensive
   considerations. Thus, the actual amount of damage caused may be reduced
   by:
     * Armour.
     * Defensive spells such as Chrenedict's Corporeal Covering.
     * Defensive rituals such as Holy Aegis.
Descriptor Effects
   It is unknown if weapon descriptors (such as "blackened" or "blued")
   have any actual effect on the wielder's visibility.  research If this
   has been marked on a page, it's because there was something that
   probably isn't known, that the person who edited the page thinks could
   be found out. Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be famous
   evermore.  This would be of particular interest to assassins and
   thieves, who would like to gain covert benefits from blackened or blued
   weapons.
   There may also be other descriptors which may have other effects on
   game mechanics.  research If this has been marked on a page, it's
   because there was something that probably isn't known, that the person
   who edited the page thinks could be found out. Perhaps you could figure
   this thing out, and be famous evermore.
   On the other hand, is it also possible that descriptors have no direct
   effects beyond inspiring creators to match weapon characteristics with
   the item's name and description as they feel appropriate, which might
   lead to some variance in application.

Footnotes
    1. ↑ The distribution mudlib has this as lower difficulty rating (bug)
       - this has been confirmed as been fixed.
    2. ↑ To find out which hand your off-hand is, unhold everything and
       then hold a single-handed weapon. Your off-hand is the hand you
       aren't holding your weapon in. Note that, unusually, most players
       on the Disc are left-handed, so your off-hand is probably your
       right.
    3. ↑ As of this announcement , though see also this one .

Retrophrenologist
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   A retrophrenologist is an npc who can permanently change your stats.
   One service they provide is increasing a stat by one point while
   decreasing a different stat by one point. This is known as retroing,
   and can be done multiple times.

Retroing
   If you're not happy with your current stat arrangement, and you have
   already rearranged (or don't want to yet), you can get a
   retrophrenologist to permanently move a point from one stat to another.
   You can't make a stat (permanently) lower than 8 or higher than 23 this
   way.
   Saying "help" gets their attention; after that you may have to say
   "yes" multiple times. They will ask you which stat you want to decrease
   and which one you want to increase, then tell you how much it will cost
   and ask you to confirm.
   After you confirm, they'll take your money and perform the operation.
   This will leave you unconscious for five minutes and with severe
   temporary penalties to all of your stats for roughly an hour after
   that. Notably, your lowered strength is likely to cause you to drop
   anything you aren't wearing (including money), so you should put
   everything besides the retrophrenologist's fee in worn containers if
   you don't want to drop it. The stat penalties last a while, although
   the Restore ritual can fix it. You can be restored before you regain
   consciousness, so it is worthwhile to contact a Pishite before getting
   knocked out.
Cost
   The base cost is &&&&&&&&&&+40000 $100 multiplied by the total number
   of retrophrenology moves you've made in total - so your first move
   would be &&&&&&&&&&+40000 $100, the second would be
   &&&&&&&&&&+80000 $200, the third &&&&&&&&&+120000 $300 etc. - however,
   there is a premium for making multiple moves in a short space of time.
   Whenever you pay for a move, the price for the NEXT move is immediately
   set to &&&&&&&&+5640000 $14100 multiplied by the total moves you've
   made... so immediately following your first move, a 2nd move would cost
   you &&&&&&&&+5640000 $14100. Immediately following your second move,
   the price of a 3rd move would be &&&&&&&+11280000 $28200... a 4th move
   would be &&&&&&&+16920000 $42300, then &&&&&&&+22560000 $56400 etc.
   However, the price will drop by &&&&&&&&&&+40000 $100 multiplied by the
   total moves you've made, every real-time roundworld day. So after your
   very first retro visit, it would take 140 roundworld days (or 20 weeks)
   for the price to drop by &&&&&&&&&&+40000 $100 a day from
   &&&&&&&&+5640000 $14100 to the new base price of &&&&&&&&&&+80000 $200.
   If you then purchased a 2nd move at this price, the cost for a 3rd move
   would immediately jump to &&&&&&&+11280000 $28200, and would then drop
   by &&&&&&&&&&+80000 $200 every roundworld day, again taking 140
   roundworld days.
   In short, if you want the cheapest possible moves, you will need to
   wait 140 roundworld days between each every move to only ever pay the
   "base cost", which for a total of 5 moves would cost
   &&&&&&&&&+600000 $1500 and take 560 days, or 80 weeks to do. But there
   is nothing other than price stopping you doing all fives moves in the
   same day - which would cost you &&&&&&&+56440000 $141100.
Rearranging
   If you have not rearranged yet, you can go to a retrophrenologist and
   say "rearrange" to start the process. This lets you change your stats
   according to your preferences, with some restrictions: a stat may not
   be less than 8 or greater than 23, and all your stats can add up to at
   most 65. As you must "say rearrange", pay attention to the language you
   are using. 60 levels in the retrophrenologist's language seems to be
   enough.
   This is free, but you may only do it once. It's therefore advisable to
   make sure you know what you're doing first, since your rearrange
   affects all your skills, your regeneration rates for gp and hp, the
   amount you can carry, and other things.
   Unlike retroing, you will not end up unconscious when you rearrange,
   nor will you suffer penalties to your stats. It is no longer necessary
   to go to a retrophrenologist in order to rearrange, and all newbies
   start with the rearrange command.
Locations
     * Zorgo the Retrophrenologist sets up shop in Ankh-Morpork, in the
       Isle of Gods.
     * Mr Ralph Womblefluff in Ohulan Cutash has his operating room on
       Long Alley.
     * Ptricza Ptrete's house of retrophrenology is on Ephebe Road in
       Djelibeybi, near its northeast end.
     * Ral-Fee's Retro-Spa is on Onetwolong Avenue in Bes Pelargic
       (running along the southern edge of the city on the west side).
     * Vinred's tent in the North-West of the Oasis where Ephebian
       speakers can get an initial rearrange.
Notes
   Attacking/attempting to kill a retrophrenologist NPC anywhere, will
   cause ALL retrophrenologists across the Disc to all hate you.
   Attempting to enter any Retrophrenologist room anywhere afterwards will
   cause you to be immediately knocked unconscious for 5 roundworld
   minutes, and thrown to the outside room. This effect lasts an unknown
   (currently) amount of time, but at least several months (?).
   Attempting to get a killing blow on a retrophrenologist will cause them
   to steal all of your money - all coins on you, all coins in any
   container on you, regardless of how much you have, with no way to
   retrieve the money afterwards.

Stats
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   A player's stats are the basic attributes of that player, and affect
   their ability to perform almost all actions.
Contents
     * 1 Starting out
     * 2 Viewing stats
     * 3 Changing stats
          + 3.1 Permanent changes
          + 3.2 Temporary changes
     * 4 Stats, skills and bonuses
          + 4.1 Summary
          + 4.2 Calculations
     * 5 Stats/Skills Total Relationship
     * 6 See also
     * 7 External links
   There are five stats:
     * Constitution (Con) - determines the player's ability to endure
       hardship, and is particularly relevant to their hit point total.
     * Dexterity (Dex) - determines how nimble and agile the player is,
       and is particlarly relevant to covert abilities.
     * Intelligence (Int) - determines the player's ability to apply logic
       and reason, and is particularly relevant to spellcasting.
     * Strength (Str) - determines how strong a player is, and is
       particularly relevant to combat and burden.
     * Wisdom (Wis) - determines the player's ability to draw on their
       experience, and is particularly relevant to faith.
Starting out
   All players start out with 13 points in each stat.
Viewing stats
   The 'score stats' command shows your stats.
Changing stats
   There are a variety of ways to change one's stats:
Permanent changes
     * The rearrange command can be used at the player's first visit to
       the retrophrenologist. It allows a player to set each of their
       stats to anywhere between 8 and 23, as long as the total of 65 is
       maintained. This command can only be used once, so think carefully
       (and preferably take advice from your guild) before using it.
     * Additional visits to the retrophrenologist can increase one stat by
       one point at the expense of one point in another stat.
Temporary changes
     * Stat items will change a player's stats in a variety of ways when
       worn or wielded.
     * Some spells and rituals affect the stats of their target.
     * Some poisons and potions affect the stats of their target.
     * All stats are lowered after dying and being raised.
     * A burden of 50% or more decreases the dexterity stat.
   See more on the Stat effects page.
Stats, skills and bonuses
   All skill bonuses are determined by two factors - the level to which a
   player has advanced in that skill, and the skill's stat dependencies.
   The effect from the stats is determined by weightings that are fixed
   for each individual skill.
   For example, consider the skill magic.items.scroll. The weights
   associated with this skill are:
     * Con: 0
     * Dex: 1
     * Int: 2
     * Str: 0
     * Wis: 2
   This skill is strongly affected by intelligence and wisdom, weakly
   affected by dexterity, and not affected at all by constitution or
   strength.
Summary
   For those not interested in the maths, the following are the important
   points of the skill/stat relationship:
     * Changing a stat with a higher weighting on a skill has a bigger
       effect than changing a stat with a lower weighting.
     * For two stats with equal weightings, changing the lower of the two
       will have a bigger effect than changing the higher.
Calculations
   Each skill bonus is proportional to the weighted logarithmic product of
   the player's stats. The specific relationship is:
 bonus = <level factor> * 1/9.8 * ln(''weighted product'') - 0.25
   Returning to magic.items.scroll, a player with Dex: 13, Int: 18, Wis: 8
   and 100 levels in this skill will have a bonus of 194, and the
   corresponding stat factor is:
1/9.8 * ln(13 * 18 * 18 * 8 * 8) - 0.25 = 1.026
   Now imagine that this player puts on a bronze helm (-3 con, +3 int, +2
   wis). How will this affect their bonus? The stat factor is now:
1/9.8 * ln(13 * 21 * 21 * 10 * 10) - 0.25 = 1.103
   1.103 is 7.5% higher than 1.026, so the bonus likewise increases by
   7.5% to 209.
Stats/Skills Total Relationship
   This shows the importance of each stat and how much bonus you would get
   for each point you have as well as the priority based on average below.
   Int: 14 Dex: 9 Wis: 5 Str: 4 Con: 2
   Each point would roughly effect your entire bonuses.
   This reflects every skill using the stat/skill relationship total.

Stat effects
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Stat effects change one or more of the five basic attributes (stat) of
   a character.
   Some effects conflict with each other and with stat items, which are
   items that provide at least partly positive stat effects.
   The effects of being subjected to conflicted effects/items is explained
   in the Combining_stat_items section.
   Other stat effects do not interact with stat items or other stat
   effects, they come under positive and partly positive and negative.

     * 7 The Best Combination
Interactions
   Any reduction of strength that causes you to become burdened 50% or
   more will additionally give a dexterity penalty due to the burden.
   Many stat items and effects affect more than one stat.
Combining stat items
   This has changed on Tue Jul 2 11:30:32 2024
The effects of stacking stat items are no longer dependent on the order in which
 you equip the items. For positive stat effects, the final effect should now be
the best boost that was possible with the old calculation. Moreover, the bless r
itual will no longer interfere with equipped stat items.
Note that for some combinations of items, the negative stat effects are now slig
htly harsher than before; for example, wearing a flat cap and bronze helm now gi
ves you -4 con instead of -3 con. This was an unavoidable side-effect of the new
 calculation, but we hope that it is an acceptable price to pay for the consiste
ncy and bless-proof-ness of the new system.
If there is a combination you rely on that is now overall substantially worse fo
r you when both positive and negative effects are taken into consideration, plea
se make a bugrep on one of the relevant items, stating all of the following info
rmation: what items make up the combo, what it used to give you, what it gives y
ou now, and why this is a problem (in as much detail as possible).
Equipable Stat Items
Bronze helm (+3 Int, +2 Wis, -3 Con)
   +3 intelligence, +2 wisdom, -3 constitution
   Does HP damage and eventually kills if worn for too long.
Dex Gloves (+2 Dex, -1 Str)
   +2 dexterity, -1 strength, Drains GP
Flat cap (+3 Wis, +2 Int, -3 Str)
   +3 wisdom, +2 intelligence, -3 strength
   Does HP damage, and eventually kills if worn for too long.
Klein bottle (+1 Int or +2 Int)
   A Klein bottle gives +1 of intelligence while the bottle is held and
   filled with "small waves", "eddying currents", "turbulence",
   "whirlpool" or "maelstrom" of energy.
   A Klein bottle gives +2 of intelligence while the bottle is held and
   filled with "tempest", "vortex" or "impossible chaos" of energy.
Prayer beads (+1 Wis or +2 Wis)
   +1 wisdom at bright, +2 wisdom at radiant
   These must be held and charged by using faith gp before they become
   stat items.
   Wizards and Witches are unable to hold prayer beads, so are unable to
   gain any stat benefit from prayer beads, even when fully charged.
Strength Gauntlets (+2 Str)
   +2 strength, drains GP
Thief's daggers (+1 Dex)
   +1 dexterity
   Two of them must be held at once.
Positive effects that interfere with stat items and each other
Bless (+1 All)
   Gained from the ritual.
     * The effect of Bless is suppressed during the use of any stat items.
     * This means that while any stat item is active (worn, held) Bless
       has no effect.
     * Bless is not canceled, if you remove/unhold all stat items while
       Bless is still active then the effect returns.
   Ways to get bless without a player performing it:
     * By offering tobacco or makeup at the shrine to Oshun at the
       northwest end of Lover's Walk in Genua.
     * Inside a hidden shrine to the Small Gods in Djelibeybi if your
       alignment is good enough, but it takes a while to reset after an
       attempted use.
     * You can try searching a cairn in Djelibeybi, but you might get a
       lightning bolt to the head instead.
     * It is one of the rewards for giving a sacrifice at one of the
       sacrificial altars in Ephebe, but wizards and witches cannot
       receive rewards for it.
     * There's a shrine in the courtyard of the Chronides farmhouse where
       you can offer incense for a bless.
Blink (+1 Str)
   Witches can squint with method blinking thereby inspiring humans to
   have +1 strength for a while.
     * There is no confirmed blink that increased strength by +2, though
       this might be possible with godly bonuses.
     * Blink used to interfere with stat items and other effects in this
       section, but it should be tested again.   research If this has been
       marked on a page, it's because there was something that probably
       isn't known, that the person who edited the page thinks could be
       found out. Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be famous
       evermore.
Positive stat effects (or partly positive) that do not conflict with other
effects
Berserk (+1 Str and Dex)
   Gained from the command. After berserk wears off, there will be -2 to
   strength and constitution for a while.
     * Can only be used by warriors.
Chocolate die (+1 or +2 random stat, -1 after)
   Sold at the Mad Wolf sweetie shop.
     * Usually gives +1 to a random stat for a while, and then -1 to that
       stat for a while afterwards.
     * Other times it gives -1 to a stat for a while, and then +1 to that
       stat for a while afterwards.
     * It's also possible to receive +2 to a random stat instead, and -1
       for a while afterwards.
     * The chance of that may depend on being a valued customer at the
       shop.
     * Consuming an additional die while still under the effects of a
       first gives -1 constitution. You have to wait for a message that
       says "you feel normal again" before eating a new die without
       penalty.
     * This stat effect appears to stack with other stat effects.
Edible cockroaches (+1 int, -5 con, -2 dex)
   Eating edible cockroaches can give you +1 intelligence for about 5
   minutes, but also -5 constitution and -2 dexterity.
Ephebian horse (+2 int)
   A replica of the wooden horse used in the Tsortean wars is located in
   the northeast outside the citadel in Ephebe.
     * Being inside for around 15 seconds gives +2 intelligence for about
       15 minutes, followed by +1 intelligence for the next 15 minutes.
     * This bonus can be used without interfere with other stat effects.
Intelligence tea (+1 int, then -1 int)
   Gives +1 intelligence when drunk, and then -1 intelligence for a while.
   This effect can be combined with other effects that do not affect
   intelligence.
Sek altar (+1 str)
   Putting a human heart on the Sek low altar in Ankh-Morpork gives you +1
   strength for 15 minutes.
     * This can be combined with other effects without experiencing
       additional negative modifiers.
Shrine (+2 wis)
   Going in a shrine to the Small Gods and waiting there a while gives you
   a +2 wisdom boost for about 15 minutes, followed by +1 wisdom for the
   next 15 minutes, similar to the Ephebian horse's intelligence boost.
     * This can be combined with other effects without experiencing
       additional negative modifiers.
     * These shrines can also bring you back to life if you suffer an
       untimely demise.
   You know that you are in such a room when you get this message on
   entry:
You feel a sense of peace here.
   The most widely used shrine to the Small Gods is on Sinners' Walk just
   south of the market in Ohulan Cutash.
     * You regain gp and can use commands there.
   The mountain shrine to the Small Gods in a cave southwest of the
   Giants' land also works.
     * You cannot regain gp and cannot use commands in that cave.
     * The cave is in a dangerous areas inhabited by yetis and lynxes that
       pursue and evil trolls at night that do not pursue.
   There is a shrine to the Small Gods in Razorback but it doesn't provide
   the wisdom boost.
     * You can fill a cup chained there and drink it, the ice cold water
       making you feel strong/agile/wise/intelligent/healthy and the
       reverse weak/clumsy/silly/stupid/sick but this doesn't seem to have
       any effect.
Mazda's statue (thief only +1 dex)
   If a thief fences a stolen item of sufficient value to the statue of
   Mazda in the entrance hall of the AM Thieves' Guild, in exchange he
   will bestow +1 dexterity for a short amount of time.
     * The item must be stolen and expensive, this seems to be related to
       your guild level.
     * Mazda will only accept offerings from thieves.
Warrior's Brain Cell (warriors +1 int & +1 str, others: +1 str & -1 int)
   When eaten, gives +1 intelligence to warriors and +1 strength and -1
   intelligence to others.
Wungle's Great Sucking (+1 con up to +3 con)
   Up to +3 constitution boost for the caster. Constitution reduction for
   the victim. This can be safely combined with other stat items and
   effects that do not affect constitution.
     * A failure may cause -2 constitution for the caster.
Negative stat effects
Arms, removed or on armpit (-1 to -8 dex)
   Causes:
     * Casting in an area with high thaums can get your arms (or legs)
       torn off by the Thyngs from the Dungeon Dimensions.
     * A major fail when casting Booch's Extremal Polymorphism removes an
       arm.
     * Casting Booch's Extremal Polymorphism causes the caster to grow a
       new arm (that doesn't fall off after a time limit) and causes all
       arms (including the original two) susceptible to being lost during
       normal combat, even if the damage is absorbed by shields or the
       attack is parried.
     * Casting Yordon's Extremal Extension causes the caster to grow one
       extra new arm, but it falls off when the spell expires. This
       typically takes around 15 minutes, but a fluke cast can last 4
       hours.
   Penalties:
     * Losing just one of your original arms -1 dex penalty.
     * Losing both original arms -8 dex penalty, even if you currently
       have other non-standard arms.
     * Having a left/right armpit arm -2 dex, or -3 dex if you have both
       armpit arms.
   Fixing:
     * You can go to the Igor in the Five Ways bell tower (under a slab)
       and ask him to fix you.
     * Dying resets your arms to the original two, this works even if it
       is not a death that takes a life like a PK death, dying in the PK
       Arena or dying in CTF.
Broken leg(s) (-3 dex per broken leg, walking on them also reduces dex, str &
con)
   Each broken leg gives you a penalty of -3 dexterity.
     * In addition, trying to walk on broken legs reduces dexterity, then
       strength and constitution.
     * The penalties to strength and constitution can be cured with
       Restore, but will reoccur after you walk again.
     * To permanently deal with broken legs, witches can splint your legs,
       or doctor npcs in fixed locations can "set" your legs.
Burden (-1 to -6 dex)
     * 50-74% burden results in a -1 dex penalty.
     * 74-99% burden results in a -2 dex penalty.
     * 100-124% burden results in a -3 dex penalty.
     * 125-149% burden results in a -4 dex penalty.
     * 150-174% burden results in a -5 dex penalty.
     * 175-200% burden results in a -6 dex penalty.
Common cold (-1 to -6 str)
   Reduces strength, stand in a smithy or take cold cure to get rid of it.
     * Interacting with Pewsey around Granny's cottage in any way will
       give you a cold.
Crawling (-5 dex)
   Reduces dexterity by 5 for as long as you're crawling.
Cross-contemplation (-4 int, then -2 int, then -1 int)
   Contemplating a spell, and then contemplating a different spell before
   you've fed enough gp into the first one will give you an intelligence
   penalty of -4, then -2, and then -1.
     * The time each penalty lasts depends on an unknown factor, possibly
       gp used for the second contemplate or both contemplates combined,
       and may be any duration from less than 20 seconds to over 20
       minutes.
Donating blood (-2 con)
   Donating blood to the Igor in the side room of the dark classy bar
   gives -2 constitution for about 15 minutes.
Flying Cockroaches (-1 int per cockroach in your brain)
   There are flying cockroaches that flies on to you and burrows into your
   brain. They appear sometimes when searching a the room with the acids
   in the Alchemists' Guild.
     * For each cockroach that stays for a few seconds before you shake it
       off you receive -1 intelligence stat penalty for a few minutes.
     * After being shaken, the cockroach returns to the room where it can
       try to fly back at you a few seconds later.
     * Armour and arcane shields are ineffective at preventing the
       cockroaches from burrowing into your brain.
     * A high bonus in dodging is very effective to keep them off.
Fyodor's Nimbus of Porterage (-1 or -2 int, -2 or -3 str)
   Casting the spell Fyodor's Nimbus of Porterage results in reduced
   intelligence and strength. The exact amount of the reduction varies,
   and both stats will go back to normal over time.
Gammer Shorga's Clever Creeper (-1 int on success, on failure -3 int)
   -1 intelligence when cast successfully for about 15 minutes.
   -3 intelligence on cast failure for about 2 minutes.
GP Tea (-1 int after)
   When you drink GP tea it gives you a boost of gp. When it expires it
   tries to removes the gp boost that it gave when drunk and it can give
   you a penalty of -1 intelligence, especially if it cannot get all the
   gp back because it would put you below 0.
Heatstroke (-1 to -5 int & wis)
   Heatstroke will eventually give -1 to both intelligence and wisdom,
   increasing to -2 in both somewhere around the point you are "close to
   death from extreme heatstroke", then increasing further to -3, then -4,
   then -5.
     * The stat penalty can also go down while you still have heatstroke.
     * A convenient place to get heatstroke is Sek's high altar in Bes
       Pelargic, as it is "incredibly, unbelievably hot" there.
     * Stand somewhere cool, remove warm clothing to get rid of it.
       Heatstroke can kill.
Hundred year old eggs (-1 to -8 dex)
   Eating one of these will make you sick, causing a gradually increasing
   loss of dexterity from -1 to -8.
   However, if you eat a second hundred year old egg too soon after the
   effects of eating the first one wears off, then you just get a penalty
   of -2, then -1 dex for some time.
Hypothermia (-1 to -3 con, -1 to -4 str)
   Damages strength and constitution. Stand in a smithy to get rid of it.
   Hypothermia can kill.
Inhaling Water (-1 con)
   Trying to talk while underwater causes you to inhale water. This
   negative effect can stack. Your health returns to normal after about 15
   minutes.
Lead Nose (-2 con, -2 int, -2 wis)
   A lead nose from Who Nose gives you -2 to constitution, intelligence,
   and wisdom for as long as you wear the nose.
Mocking yourself (-2 wis, then -1 wis)
   Each attempt to mock yourself gives you -2 wisdom for 15 minutes, then
   -1 wisdom for another 15 minutes for a total of 30 minutes of stat
   loss.
Ohulan Cutash doctor (-1 con)
   Letting the "doctor" in Ohulan Cutash operate on you leaves you with -1
   constitution for about 10 minutes. The effect stacks--doing it twice in
   a row will give you -2, and so on.
   Restore will remove the stat effect.
Pandora's Box (-2 con, -2 str, +2 wis)
   Opening Pandora's Box gives you -2 constitution, -2 strength, and +2
   wisdom for a bit, lessening to -1, -1, and +1 after a while.
     * The entire stat effect lasts about half an hour, and the box
       explodes when opened. The effect also comes with emotes.
Scorpion Poison Sac (-5 con, -2 dex)
   Eating a scorpion poison sac results in -5 constitution and -2
   dexterity.
Scorpion Sting (-5 con, -2 dex)
   Scorpions in Djelibeybi sting everyone fighting in the room they're in.
   This does not make them fight the victims so they can keep stinging.
The cautious scorpion viciously stabs the outgoing wealthy woman with its tail!
 The outgoing wealthy woman seethes in agony.
The cautious scorpion stabs you with its tail!  You seethe in agony.
Your eyeballs melting would be less torture.
   The result is a stat loss of -5 constitution and -2 dexterity, like
   eating a scorpion poison sac.
   In addition, each time you get the eyeballs melting message you seem to
   take about 5% hitpoints of damage.
   Drinking antidote tea cures the stat loss and prevents further damage
   being done.
Scroll-handling check (-1 to -3 intelligence and/or wisdom)
A surreptitious rustling sound starts emanating from your person.
There is a bright flash of light as a couple of spells escape from their scrolls
, leaving you slightly dazed.
An intense flash of light bursts forth as a few spells escape from their scrolls
, leaving you quite dizzy.
     * This can temporarily reduce your stats, the following have recently
       be seen: -1 int, -2 wis; int unchanged, -3 wis.
     * Sometimes this also hurts, about 100 hp damage has been seen.
     * If your intelligence goes down enough, you'll fall unconscious for
       a while.
   The following has not been seen in a while, please confirm if this
   happened to you in the last year:
     * The reduced stats also reduces bonus. this causes an additional
       skillcheck against your remaining scrolls.
     * The cycle of failed skillcheck -> reduced intelligence -> reduced
       bonus -> new skillcheck -> failed skillcheck can repeat several
       times, causing damage each time. This can be fatal!
Spider Poison (-5 con, -2 dex)
   Reduces constitution.
Unquiet Spirit (fail: -1 or more con)
   Failing Unquiet Spirit can damage your constitution.
Wungle's Body Part Suggestion (-1 con or more)
   Constitution reduction for the victim while the spleen is running
   about, longer if the spleen runner is killed.
Yarrow (-5 con & -2 dex)
   Eating 2 handful of yarrow and waiting 2 minutes gives -5 constitution
   and -2 dexterity.
     * Antidote tea cures it.
Vampire bite (-2 dex, -2 int, -2 str, -2 wis)
   Vampires have a special bite attack that causes temporary stat loss of
   -2 dexterity, -2 intelligence, -2 strength and -2 wisdom.
     * It can also make the victim stumble around and fall unconscious.
The Best Combination
   The best stat boosting combination known gives an overall boost of +14
   to stats, and is achieved as follows:
     * Bless for +1 all
     * Wungle's Great Sucking for +3 constitution
     * Intelligence tea for +1 intelligence
     * Ephebian horse for +2 intelligence
     * Sek Altar for +1 strength
     * Shrine for +2 wisdom
   Con Dex Int Str Wis

   You can replace the bless for any stat item, for example with strength
   gauntlets:
     * Wungle's Great Sucking for +3 constitution
     * Intelligence tea for +1 intelligence
     * Ephebian horse for +2 intelligence

   Items are physical objects that a player can interact with in some
   fashion. This is a very broad category with many sub-categories. Item
   pages that belong in logical sub-categories should only appear there
   and not here directly. Sorting everything in a useful way is an ongoing
   process.
   A great many items can be found in the following item databases:
     * Kefka's item database - Can also be searched for shops, menus and
       npcs.
     * Quow's Cow Bar Database Search (item) - Can also be searched for
       places and npcs. The same database can be found in Quow's Cow Bar,
       except for stuff added between releases.

Defend
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
          This article is a stub. You can help Discworld MUD Wiki by
          expanding it.
   Defend is a command you can use to defend another person. You will
   attempt to parry on their behalf, and so defend them.
   If you use this command without any arguments it shows who is defending
   you and who you are defending in the room.
   Conversely, to stop defending, you can undefend.

Syntax
> defend <living>
You defend <living>.
> defend
No one is defending you.
Of the people in this room, you are defending <living>.
> undefend <living>
You stop defending <living>.
Mechanics
     * Defending someone makes you attempt to parry on their behalf. This
       is less extreme than protect, which makes you move bodily in the
       way of the attack to take the hit.
     * You need to have your combat response set to parry or block to
       defend. It does not work with dodging because jumping out of the
       way would not hamper the incoming attacks in the least.
     * When Defending someone, keep in mind that your AP will take a
       massive hit every time you attempt to block or parry on their
       behalf. As such, you may make fewer/no attacks per round in the
       event that they are attacked multiple times. You also may not take
       defensive actions on your own behalf in this case.
     * Defending against any attacks will pull you into combat with any
       enemies that are attempting to harm your ward.
     * If you are parrying to defend your ward you can use riposte to
       attempt to maintain an offensive stand under the AP constraints of
       defending your ward.

Protect
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Protect is a command you can use to protect another person. You will
   attempt to take melee damage on their behalf, and so protect them.
   If you use this command without any arguments it shows who is
   protecting you and who you are protecting in the room.
   Conversely, to stop protecting someone, you can unprotect.
Contents
     * 1 Syntax
     * 2 Mechanics

Syntax
> protect <living>
You move to protect <living>.
> protect
No one is protecting you.
Of the people in this room, you are protecting <living>.
> unprotect <living>
You stop protecting <living>.
Mechanics
     * Protecting someone means that you will jump in front of as many
       attacks against the protected being as you can, but unlike defend
       which will try to parry the attacks, you will receive the hits
       without trying to parry, block or dodge them.
     * Without armour or arcane protection, protect involves a great deal
       of risk as you are losing HP on their behalf.
     * A decent armour and arcane protections such as Major/Minor Shield,
       TPA and Bug shield can help keep you alive by absorbing damage that
       would otherwise reduce your HP. It is also advisable to have a lot
       of HP, more than 2500, so that shields that expire and special
       attacks do not kill you before you can react.
     * Protecting someone from an attack will pull you into combat with
       any enemies that are attempting to harm your ward.
     * When Protecting someone, you use up a decent chunk of AP, as such,
       you may make fewer/no attack per round, and stop moving to defend
       yourself from incoming attacks if your ward is attacked multiple
       times. On the other hand, it costs less AP to Protect someone than
       to Defend them.
     * It is very possible for you to die on someone else's behalf if you
       are Protecting them. Unless you unprotect when your HP is low you
       will continue to leap in front of attacks until you die.
     * While casting spells you will not leap in front of anyone you are
       protecting, essentially making the caster not protect while
       casting. This means that your ward will have to deal with all the
       attacks as if you were not protecting.

Vurdere
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Mudlib-unconf.gif This page contains formulae or data from the
   distribution mudlib. This information may be several years out of date,
   so needs to be verified as correct. You can help by performing research
   to validate it.

   Vurdere is a command which can be used to gain an rough idea of how
   much good a piece of armour is at blocking damage. It can also be used
   to compare two pieces of armour to see which is better. It costs 25 GP
   to vurdere a single item, and 25 GP for each additional item when doing
   multiple comparisons, up to a maximum of 10 items.
   Vurdere takes into account:
     * The base armour class of the armour.
   Vurdere does not take into account:
     * The degree of enchantment of the armour.
     * The armour's condition.
     * The armour's weight.
     * Any of the player's skills.
   When used to compare multiple pieces of armour, the accuracy of the
   command is dependent on the player's adventuring.evaluating.armour
   bonus.
Reported quality
   The reported quality of the armour is dependent only on the armour's
   base AC. The vurdere command reports the quality separately versus the
   three physical damage types (blunt, sharp and pierce).
   You can vurdere several items at once separately.
     * For example: "vurdere armour 1 & armour 2 & armour 3"
     * This uses 25 gp per item vurdered.
     * There's no decrease in xp return with more items.
     * The maximum amount of armours you can vurdere at once seems to be
       skill-dependent, 12 for a 222 bonus.
   The following table indicates the base AC for each vurdere rating:
   Base AC    Vurdere
   0-3     Terrible
   4-7     Amazingly poor
   8-11    Pretty poor
   12-15   Poor
   16-18   OK
   19-22   Average
   23-26   Good
   27-30   Very good
   31-33   Extremely good
   34+     Excellent
Vurdere against
   You can vurdere an armour piece against another to get a rough idea of
   how different their AC is. This uses 50 adventuring gp.
   First though (according to the mudlib) you need a good enough bonus to
   tell them apart.
   Specifically, below a 350 bonus in ad.ev.ar, items that differ in
   absolute value less than the following will vurdere as "is the same
   as".
          smallest AC difference that you can vurdere = (350 - bonus) / 10
   If you can tell the items apart you get one of the following message:
               Message              AC difference
   is exactly the same as           0
   is slightly <better/worse> than  1 - 9
   is <better/worse> than           10 - 19
   is much <better/worse> than      20 - 39
   is amazingly <better/worse> than 40+
   These AC values seem to be absolute in the mudlib (as seen in
   cmds/guild-race/other/vurdere.c).
Other information
   Vurdere also reports which body areas are covered by the armour.

Condition
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   The condition command tells you how much an item is damaged. It can be
   used on multiple items at once, or even on "all".
Contents
     * 1 Using the command
     * 2 Condition stages
     * 3 Changing condition
     * 4 Material
     * 5 See also
     * 6 External links
Using the command
   There are several available syntaxes:
condition <item(s)> damaged sorting {up|down}
condition <item(s)> sorting {up|down}
condition <item(s)> damaged
condition <item(s)>
   The "damaged" argument will cause it to ignore items in excellent
   condition.
   Note that you can use "damaged" as an adjective for other commands;
   i.e., "fix damaged weapon" or "locate damaged things". Using the
   adjective damaged will find items that condition damaged will not find,
   those items that have excellent condition but are not at 100 % of their
   total condition.
   Adding "sorting up" will cause it to list the items from most damaged
   to least damaged, while adding "sorting down" will cause it to list
   them from least damaged to most damaged.
Condition stages
    % of
   total
   condition Item is <condition>
             91 - 100            in excellent condition.
             81 - 90             in very good condition.
             71 - 80             in good condition.
             61 - 70             in decent condition.
             51 - 60             in fairly good condition.
             41 - 50             in fairly poor condition.
             31 - 40             in poor condition.
             21 - 30             in really poor condition.
             11 - 20             in very poor condition.
             1 - 10              in atrocious condition.
             < 1                 a complete wreck.
   Some items have no condition.
Changing condition
     * Weapons get damaged when you fight with them.
     * Armour gets damaged when you're hit on the part of the body it
       covers.
     * Clothing gets damaged when you're hit on the part of the body it
       covers by slash or pierce damage, but not blunt damage. This
       includes containers that cover an area of the body.
     * Floaters get damaged when blocking damage to the caster.
     * Jewellery gets damaged (sometimes) when you cast Jogloran's Portal
       of Cheaper Travel on it.
     * A failure of Gryntard's Feathery Reliever can damage the item.
     * Failing a step during finesmithing will also damage the item you're
       working on.
     * Polishing an engraving to remove it from an item damages it a bit.
   If something is damaged too much, it will break (disappear completely)
   and be permanently lost (if a container breaks this way, the contents
   will spill out into your inventory or on the ground).
   You can improve an item's condition with the following means:
   Method Objects that can be repaired
   Fix in a smithy or a thieves' guild launder room weapons and metal worn
   items, stone shields
   Repair in a woodworking shop or a thieves' guild launder room Wooden
   things
   Leatherwork in a tannery or a thieves' guild launder room Leather
   things
   Sew with a sewing needle and sinew thread Leather things
   Sew with a sewing needle and cloth thread Cloth things
   Place on Gapp's low altar Clothes (cloth or leather)
   Mend ritual from Gapp Cloth things
   Mending npcs Clothes, jewellery, maybe others
   Improving an item's condition through these means slightly reduces its
   maximum value. This means it will cost less to repair in the future,
   but sell for less to a general store or fence. Fortunately, this has no
   effect on the durability of a blorple.
   You can directly locate most of these types of items in your inventory
   except for metal where you need to locate steel, locate iron, etc.
   You can improve clothing's condition by putting it on the low altar of
   Gapp in Ankh-Morpork--this takes faith gp, and the more gp is spent,
   the more the item will be repaired.  research If this has been marked
   on a page, it's because there was something that probably isn't known,
   that the person who edited the page thinks could be found out. Perhaps
   you could figure this thing out, and be famous evermore.  (Leather
   items usually can't be improved this way, and will just fall off the
   altar with no result.)
   Fix used to work on all weapons because woodworking areas were too few,
   this seems to have been changed back so that fix only works on metal
   items.
Material
   Objects have different characteristics based on their material.
   Appraise returns the material(s) of the item, many items have several
   materials.
   Mudlib-unconf.gif This section contains formulae or data from the
   distribution mudlib. This information may be several years out of date,
   so needs to be verified as correct. You can help by performing research
   to validate it.
   The condition of items are based on their weight and the material they
   are made of. Some materials like cloth seems to have extremely high
   condition values, but they are so much lighter that this is not as
   extreme as it looks. In the following table the condition values are
   multiplied by the weigh modifiers to help show this. Actual formulas
   used could be wildly different from this.

Decay
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Decay is a degradation over time that occurs to certain items. It can
   cause the item to change appearance and possibly disappear after the
   final stage is complete. The temperature of a room has no effect on how
   quickly things decay.
   The following items tend to decay:
     * Corpses and their parts rot.
     * Flowers wither. They can not be pickled or dried.
     * Food rots.
     * Ice and ice-cream melt.
   A helpful syntax for referring to the oldest of a kind of item that's
   been in your inventory is <item> -1. This would most likely be of use
   for consuming decayable spell or ritual components.
Preservation
   The effect can sometimes be stopped with pickling, drying via Mama
   Blackwing's Potent Preserver or the Preserve command.
   There are also containers that can prevent rot on food items (but not
   melt):
     * Hello Monkey! lunchbox
     * dusty box
     * Wizard's lunch sack from Wurphle's Packed Lunch
See Also
     * Afflictions, which can cause changes in stats and appearances to
       characters.
     * Condition, the command to view the degradation of clothing,
       weapons, and armour based on use (not time).
