Combat
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Combat--the fine art of killing things--is the most common way to gain
   experience, items, and money on the Discworld. In its most basic form,
   combat is pretty simple--you pick up a weapon, find an NPC, and hit
   them with it. Unfortunately, this "basic system" is likely to get you
   killed.

The Basics
   The first thing a new player should know about fighting is that you
   Pick On Things Your Own Size. A new character can find decent weapons
   and armour, but still has practically zero skills. He's not going to be
   able to fight even a child with a guarantee of success; larger things
   will likely squash him outright.
   This is where the consider command comes in. It measures your
   strength-- based on your held weapons, worn armour, and hit points--and
   compares it to your target. A new player will find that he is roughly
   as strong as squirrels, rats and cockroaches.
   Advancing your fighting skills will let you fight tougher foes
   successfully. For melee-friendly classes, like warriors, assassins,
   and, to a lesser extent, thieves, can be done relatively easily; you
   simply find an NPC trainer and advance your combat-related skills, as
   explained in Introduction to Skills. It's important to advance the
   skills you actually use; fighting.melee.dagger only helps when you're
   holding a dagger.
Syntax
   To start fighting something, there are two syntaxes you can use:
kill <living>
attack <living>
   You can use either one with multiple targets; e.g., "kill bodyguards",
   "kill all" (not recommended), "kill all except pets", etc.
   To stop fighting something, you can "stop fighting". This has somewhat
   limited use, since it does not stop things from fighting you (they will
   still attack you if you go back into the room with them).
   The command "score fighting" will tell you whether you are currently in
   combat with anything.
More HP for Me
   You start off with 500 hp, or hit points. That's dangerously low.
   You lose hp when successfully attacked and you will die when you lose
   all of your hp. Attacks that do hundreds of hit points in one hit are
   VERY common.
   Once you join a guild, you can advance adventuring.health to 25 in the
   guild. This will boost your maximum hp to roughly 1300. You'll want
   more hp later but, for now, the extra 800 hit points will provide you a
   much needed safety buffer.
Physical Weapons
   While some players opt to engage in physical combat with their hands
   and feet, the vast majority prefer the use of martial (or,
   occasionally, marital) weapons.
   Lighter weapons tend to be faster, but do less damage; the opposite is
   also true for their heavy counterparts. The real factor affecting a
   weapon's effectiveness, though, is the player holding it. A warrior
   with a 500 bonus in fighting.melee.dagger will be more effective with a
   dull butterknife than a brand-new player struggling to hold a Holy
   Blade of Soyin. Don't try to find the BESTEST WEAPON EVARR until you're
   more experienced; for now, choose a weapon you seem comfortable with.
Armour
   Armour, unlike weapons, does not rely on a player's skill to perform
   its function. A level 300 warrior wearing a steel breastplate is just
   as protected as a newbie wearing the same equipment.
   The most important things to remember about armour, as a newbie, are:
     * Protect your vitals. On Discworld, this means primarily your neck,
       head, and chest (in that order).
     * Watch your burden. Some armour is good; too much, however, can be
       disastrous. Acceptable burden for a dodge user is roughly 10-15
       percent; a parry-based player can often get away with as much as
       35% burden. In any case, don't let your burden climb past 50%; at
       that point, your abilities will start to be crippled by the weight.
     * This isn't Dungeons and Dragons. All guilds are allowed to wear
       armour, so feel free to put on a breastplate, even if you're a
       wizard.
Magic and Faith
   The magic and faith-based classes may also advance their combat skills
   at their trainers, though to a much more limited extent. Their real
   strength lies, of course, in their own Guild's areas of expertise. For
   example:
   Priests have, depending on their chosen god, access to a variety of
   helpful rituals. All Gods grant the Totem ritual, which summons a small
   supernatural being to the Priest's side. This being will throw itself
   in the way of most oncoming attacks, until it dies. While the Totem
   creature will attack foes, its offensive ability is severely limited.
   The totem's strength may be increased, however, by advancing the skill,
   faith.rituals.miscellaneous.target.
   Rituals like these do not (usually) change a Priest's physical
   strength; nor will Spells normally alter the physical power of a Wizard
   or Witch. Nevertheless, these powers will greatly increase an arcane
   player's ability to defend him (or her) self and inflict mortal injury
   upon those foolish enough to harass them.
   Like more direct combat-based methods, spells and rituals may be
   strengthened by advancing the relevant skills.
AP or R.I.P.
   Everyone in combat needs action points to make attacks or defend
   against attacks. The MUD will never display the action points but you
   can see the results.
   For a newbie, the most important parts are:
     * Every time you do an action in combat: attack, dodge, parry, stand
       up after being tripped, etc., you spend Action Points.
     * If you are too busy defending, you will rarely, if ever attack.
       When greatly outnumbered, you won't even be able to try to defend
       against all of the attacks. This can make fighting multiple
       opponents a fatal situation.
          + Don't "kill all" as a newbie. You don't want to be
            outnumbered.
          + Be careful when an NPC is in a room with potential allies. One
            little old lady may seem killable. She'll be a much tougher
            foe once her friends join the fight.
     * Overwhelming a foe with attacks can work in your advantage.
          + Group with friends and you can outnumber the NPCs.
          + Some spells and rituals create NPCs that fight with you. A
            priest can outnumber foes using summoned allies.
          + Picking a faster weapon, like daggers, can reduce the number
            of attacks a weak target makes--they'll be busy dodging your
            attacks.
     * You can increase your speed in combat by advancing
          + fighting.special.tactics
          + the relevant fighting.defense.* skill(s)
          + the relevant fighting.melee.* skill(s)
Know when to run
   If you're in a fight and taking the worst of it, run. The more hurt you
   are, the worse you are at combat--so get out of there before you die!
   Many NPCs will try to follow you somewhat. Moving two rooms has a
   decent chance of losing them. More distance is better, as NPCs may
   wander around. If they wander into your room while they're still upset
   with you, they'll attack you on sight.
   (Some NPCs are much more aggressive at chasing and can use pursue.
   These NPCs tend to be much too tough for newbies to fight.)

   eight branches.

Skill System
Trees and branches
   Discworld uses a skill system, which is divided into eight skilltrees:
   Adventuring (skill tree)
   Covert (skill tree)
   Crafts (skill tree)
   Faith (skill tree)
   Fighting (skill tree)
   Magic (skill tree)
   People (skill tree)
   Languages
   A tree can branch into subskills and sub-subskills.
   What you actually use is the bonus, not the level. But to increase your
   bonus you need to increase your level or change your stats, which can
   be done temporarily with stat effects.
   To refer to a skill you have to provide the path to it, for example
   fighting.defence.dodging.
     * You can abbreviate skills by only listing a few letters: skills
       fi.de.do.
     * Note that if two skills could be referred by such reduced version
       the mud will use one, but this might not be the one you want. For
       example, ma.me.me.ch is channeling, not charming, so you'd have to
       use skills ma.me.me.char instead.
   Languages are special, you start with one and need to learn others from
   specific teachers before you can improve them. They do not use stats.
Calculation of levels
   The level of the skilltree is calculated by taking the average of the
   levels of the main branches and rounding this down to the nearest
   integer. On its turn, the level of a (sub) branch is calculated the
   same way, by taking the average of the levels of the sub (sub) branches
   and rounding this down to the nearest integer.
Calculation of guild level
   A player's guild level is not the skilltree level of his specialisation
   (shown by 'skills primaries'). The guild level is calculated by taking
   the average of the level of the outermost branches and round this down
   to the nearest integer. For a wizard, the outermost branches are e.g.
   magic.methods.mental.animating and magic.methods.mental.channeling, not
   magic.methods.mental nor magic.methods.
Improving your skills
   There are 4 methods of improving your level, and hence your bonus, in a
   skill.
The Taskmaster
   To gain levels from the taskmaster you don't need to do anything, just
   using skills has a chance to advance your skills!
     * The taskmaster is the system that performs skill checks on
       Discworld. It decides if you pass or fail a skill check, the degree
       to which you do so, and whether you are to be awarded a skill
       increase as part of your attempts.
     * To TM is to gain a level from the taskmaster.
     * It is often said that you have the most chance to get a TM when you
       have 50% chance to pass a skillcheck.
   Cost: Skill increases awarded by taskmasker are "free" advancement,
   they have no XP or financial cost.
Advance: Instruction by Guild
   Every guild has a teacher who will advance you to some level in all
   skills; however, the level to which they are willing to teach you in
   various skills will depend upon your choice of guild and, in some
   cases, your specialisation within the guild.
     * This is done with the advance command (in the presence of a guild
       teacher).
     * Use the cost command (in the presence of a guild teacher) to see
       how much one or several skill advance will cost.
     * For example: cost primaries, cost magic, cost ma.points, etc.
     * Guilds will advance primaries up to level 300; all other skills are
       taught to a lower level.
     * For example, Priests may advance all faith skills up to level 300
       within the guild, but may only advance magic skills up to level 5.
     * Examples: advance magic, advance ma.sp, advance ma.sp.offensive
     * To advance a skill tree, find the advancement room/person and type
       advance [skill]. So to advance your skill tree for magic type
       "advance magic" without the quotation marks.
     * To advance a branch of a skill, simply type advance [skill.branch]
   Cost: Advancing within your guild is the second cheapest in terms of XP
   cost after taskmaster skill increases, and costs AM$ 12.50 or
   equivalent per 100k XP spent on skills.
Teachers
   All players are able to teach their skill to other players, subject to
   their bonus in the relevant skills being high enough.
     * Learning from another player is considerably more expensive than
       advancing from a guild, but always cheaper (sometimes not by much)
       than learning from yourself (see below).
   Cost: Learning from a teacher has a high XP cost, but generally has no
   financial cost. The teacher receives a portion of the XP you spend in
   return for teaching you.
Self Teaching
   Self teaching is the application of your XP to teaching yourself
   skills.
   Cost: This is the most expensive method, but it has the benefit of
   always being available, and can also be done no matter what level you
   currently have in the skill.

Attack messages
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   The following are the messages given by attack types during combat from
   the distribution mudlib.
   Mudlib-unconf.gif This page contains formulae or data from the
   distribution mudlib. This information may be several years out of date,
   so needs to be verified as correct. You can help by performing research
   to validate it.
   It appears that more powerful attack messages appear when damage
   represents a greater percentage of the victim's total health. This is
   most obvious when comparing fights against very weak opponents (frogs,
   chickens, etc.) versus tough ones. As such, the numbers included below
   from the distribution mudlib are unlikely to be directly representative
   of current code but have been kept in the hope that they might be
   useful.

   From Discworld MUD Wiki

   Tactical special attacks are special attacks which do not do any damage
   to their victim, but instead cause them to incur some degree of
   tactical disadvantage - most commonly, by depleting their action
   points.

Action points
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Action points are what determine how often someone is able to
   physically attack or defend during combat.

Overview
   During combat, each participant has an action point deficit associated
   with them. Whenever that participant physically attacks or defends,
   their deficit increases, with the cost depending on various different
   factors. Action points are replenished - reducing the deficit - at a
   (usually) constant rate with each round that passes.
   Note that unlike all the other 'points' counters, action points levels
   can not be directly viewed by a player - there is no counter that will
   show up with 'score' or any other command. The only way to gauge action
   point levels is via seeing the effects of having overly large or small
   deficits, as detailed below.
Deficits, surpluses and running out of action points
   As action points are used, players acquire offensive and defensive
   action point defecits, equal to the difference between their current
   and maximum action point levels.
   There are critical deficit thresholds associated with offensive and
   defensive actions, which are affected purely by the participant's
   tactics-attitude. The more aggressive attitudes permit the player to
   reach a higher deficit before Bad Things happen to their offense, but a
   lower deficit before Bad Things happen to their defence. The more
   defensive attitudes cause the converse effect.
Critical attacking level effects
     * If a participant has a significantly small deficit in relation to
       the critical offensive level, then they will make two attacks in a
       round.
     * If a participant's deficit increases past the critical offensive
       level, then they will not attack at all that round.
Critical defending level effects
     * Small deficits in relation to the critical defensive level do not
       confer any direct benefits (though it's always nice to have a
       surplus...).
     * If a participant's defensive deficit increases beyond the critical
       defensive level, then that participant does not attempt to defend
       incoming attacks (the attacks automatically hit).
   Note that the deficit level is to a certain extent self-correcting - if
   a fighter has used up too many action points, then their attack and
   defense rate will decrease, causing them to use less action points for
   a while. Conversely, if they have plenty of action points to spare,
   then they will attack faster, using up action points at a faster rate.
Action point cost and regeneration
   Barring effects from special attacks and spellcasting, all participants
   regenerate action points at the same constant rate. However, the action
   point cost of attacking and defending is variable based on the
   following modifiers.
Attacking cost
   The following factors affect the cost of attacking:
     * The attacker's bonus in fighting.special.tactics - higher levels
       reduce the action point cost.
     * Their bonus in the appropriate melee or ranged weapon skill. Again,
       higher levels reduce the cost.
     * The attack cost is increased in relation to the weight of the
       attacker's weapon. This penalty is mitigated somewhat if the weapon
       is held in both hands.
     * The attack cost is reduced if attacking with multiple weapons.
Defending cost
   The following factors affect the cost of defending:
     * The defender's bonus in fighting.special.tactics - higher levels
       reduce the action point cost.
     * Their bonus in the appropriate defence skill. Again, higher levels
       reduce the cost.
     * Various factors associated with their specific means of defense,
       ranging from burden to weapon weight. See dodge, parry and block
       for more details.
     * If the defender defeats the attacker's 'to-hit' skillcheck by a
       large margin (ie. they 'easily' parry/dodge/block), then the cost
       of that defence is halved or (in extreme cases) zeroed. Conversely,
       if they defeat the attacker by a very small margin ('only just
       manage to...'), then the cost of that defence is doubled.
Spellcasting
   While spellcasting, a character regenerates no action points. Note,
   however, that a player can spellcast no matter how great their action
   point deficit is.
Other ways to affect one's own action points
   In general, performing almost any action will increase one's action
   point deficit - the more time you spend doing other things, the less
   time you have to engage in combat. The following are particularly
   worthy of mention:
     * Performing most forms of special attack will cause a significant
       increase in action point deficit.
     * Casting spells also significantly increases action point deficit
       (in addition to not regenerating them).
     * Berserk drastically increases either action point regeneration or
       the critical deficit levels  research If this has been marked on a
       page, it's because there was something that probably isn't known,
       that the person who edited the page thinks could be found out.
       Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be famous evermore. .
     * Attacking an opponent will increase your opponent's action points
       deficit if they try to defend. If they have less action points,
       they can make fewer attacks. If they are making fewer attacks, you
       will spend fewer action points on defense. This will let you make
       more atacks...
          + If you're being attacked by a group of NPCs, you may have a
            huge action point deficit; this may make it difficult, if not
            nearly impossible, to fight back.
          + Traveling in a group of players or using minions can cause
            your opponent to have a high action points deficit.
Ways to affect one's opponent's action points
   There are various special commands which specifically act to consume an
   opponent's action points:
     * Trip
     * Shove
     * Feint
Defending and protecting other players
   Defending or protecting others incurs a significant extra action point
   cost, above and beyond the standard cost of performing a defensive
   action. This reflects the time taken to leap in front of the person
   being defend/protected.
     * Protecting incurs a set action point cost, very roughly equivalent
       to the cost of two attacks with reasonable skills.
     * Defending incurs twice this cost (because it's a lot harder to get
       in the way and parry than just get in the way and be hit), in
       addition to the cost involved in parrying the attack.

Tactics
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   This article is about combat settings. For tactics skill, see
   fighting.special.tactics.
   A player's tactics settings determine various options about how they
   will behave during combat.
   These settings can be viewed and set using the 'tactics' command, and
   the options available are explained in detail below.
Contents
     * 1 Response
     * 2 Parry
     * 3 Attack
     * 4 Attitude
     * 5 Focus
     * 6 See also
     * 7 External links
Response
   A player's 'response' setting determines which of the fighting.defence
   skill subtrees they will use to defend themself. It can be set to one
   of four options:
     * Dodge - with this option set, a player will always attempt to dodge
       incoming attacks, and will not attempt to parry or block them.
     * Parry - with this option set, a player will always attempt to parry
       or block incoming attacks (depending on whether the hand(s)
       specified in the 'parry' option below are holding a shield or not).
       They will not attempt to dodge.
     * Block - with this option set, a player will always attempt to block
       incoming attacks. They will not attempt to dodge nor parry.
     * Neutral - with this option set, a player will randomly decide to
       either dodge or block or parry each incoming attack.
   Generally speaking, it is preferable to decide early on whether your
   character is more suited to dodging or parrying or blocking, and set
   your response to one of these accordingly - as attempting to gain
   proficiency in both response types requires twice the amount of XP
   expenditure.
   That said, there is a minor bonus conferred in combat if a player's
   response is neutral, as the enemy isn't sure how the player will react.
Parry
   A player's 'parry' setting determines which hand (or hands) a player
   will use to parry incoming attacks. Obviously, this setting only
   applies if the 'response' setting above is set to either 'parry' or
   'neutral'.
   Available options are:
     * Left - parry only with the left hand.
     * Right - parry only with the right hand.
     * Both - randomly choose which hand to parry with for each attack.
       This confers a very slight reduction in the action point cost of
       parrying, but means that a player may find themself parrying with
       an unfavourable weapon.
     * Unarmed - determines whether the player will attempt to parry when
       unarmed or not (each time this option is set it toggles
       allowing/disallowing unarmed parrying).
   Unarmed parrying may confer some level of protection to a
   parrying-dependent character without their weapons, but it can also be
   disabling if the player isn't skilled enough  research If this has been
   marked on a page, it's because there was something that probably isn't
   known, that the person who edited the page thinks could be found out.
   Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be famous evermore. .
Attack
   A player's 'attack' setting determines which hand(s) are used to
   attack.
   Available options are:
     * Left - attack only with the left hand.
     * Right - attack only with the right hand.
     * Both - randomly choose which hand to attack with for each strike.
       This confers a very slight reduction in the action point cost of
       attacking, but means that a player may find themself attacking with
       an unfavourable weapon.
Attitude
   A player's 'attitude' setting essentially determines how aggressive or
   defensive the player is in combat. This affects a number of things, as
   detailed in the table below.
   Attitude Extra GP drain per attack Extra GP drain per defence Action
   point limit for attacking Action point limit for defending To hit
   modifier To defend modifier
   Insane 1 2 200% 50% +25% -50%
   Offensive 0 1 100% 100% +15% -25%
   Neutral 0 0 66% 150% 0% 0%
   Defensive 1 0 50% 200% -25% +15%
   Wimp 2 1 25% 300% -50% +25%
   The action point limits in the above table should be treated as
   relative to each other for the same skill level, rather than anything
   absolute. Note that a player generally has higher action point limits
   for defending than attacking, as people are prone to avoiding pain.
   The to-hit and to-defend bonuses are roughly equivalent to improving or
   worsening the chance to hit or defend by that much (but be aware that a
   great many other factors also influence this test).
   Having a floater swoop will drain gp when defensive actions cost extra,
   same as dodge, parry or block.
Focus
   A player's 'focus' option determines which part of the body their
   attacks will be aimed at.
   Available options are:
     * Specific parts of the human body (head, neck, chest, abdomen, arms,
       hands, legs, feet) - in which case all attacks will be aimed at
       that area.
     * More general areas - upper body and lower body.
     * None - just choose randomly.
   See here for details on the likelihood of hitting various body parts if
   the 'upper/lower body' or 'none' options are selected. If one of the
   specific areas has been selected, and the target is not humanoid, then
   the target area will be mapped onto a roughly similar area (eg. chest,
   abdomen, arms, legs, hands and feet might all strike the body area of a
   snake).
   Setting focus to a particular area may be useful in that it can be used
   to get avoid armoured areas on the opponent, or to hit more
   damage-sensitive areas (such as the face), however, attempting to focus
   on a specific area incurs a significant to-hit penalty:
     * No penalty for focus 'none'
     * Penalty very roughly equivalent to 25% chance to hit for 'upper
       body' or 'lower body' focus.
     * Penalty very roughly equivalent to 0 to 25% chance to hit for
       focusing on specific areas, depending on how big the area is
       (bigger areas incur a lesser penalty).

   Dodging is the means of defence by which an the defender avoids an
   incoming physical attack by moving out of the way.
Contents
     * 1 Applicability
     * 2 Mechanics
          + 2.1 Chance of dodging
          + 2.2 Action point cost
     * 3 Somehow avoid
     * 4 Spellcasting
     * 5 Defend and riposte
     * 6 See also
     * 7 Footnotes
Applicability
   Dodging can only be used to avoid physical attacks, thus it is useless
   against magic.
   Dodging can be used to avoid either a melee attack or a ranged attack;
   if successfully executed then the defender takes no damage.
   In order to dodge, tactics-response must be set to either 'neutral' or
   'dodge'.
Mechanics
   There are two factors associated with dodging:
     * How likely is an incoming attack to be dodged?
     * How many action points does dodging an attack cost?
   These are addressed below:
Chance of dodging
   A character's basic chance of dodging an incoming attack is determined
   by a skillcheck of their fighting.defence.dodging skill against the
   relevant weapon skill of the attacker (eg. fighting.melee.sword or
   fighting.range.thrown).
   This chance is then modified by the following factors specific to the
   defender's dodging^[1]:
     * There is a penalty to dodging in direct proportion to the degree of
       burden of the defender. It's hard to leap out of the way of an
       attack in time when you're lugging a lot of equipment about.
     * Additionally, there is a further penalty based on burden if your
       burden level is more than twice your dexterity stat. This is a
       considerably more dramatically increasing penalty than the one
       above, and is best avoided.
     * There is a minor bonus to dodging proportional to the weight of the
       attacker's weapon (heavier weapons are slower, thus easier to
       dodge).
Action point cost
   The action point cost of dodging starts at a constant base level, and
   is then modified as follows:
     * The cost is reduced with higher skills in fighting.defence.dodging
       and fighting.special.tactics.
     * There is a diminishing-returns penalty based on the burden of the
       dodger (the more burdened you are, the more momentum you need to
       overcome after dodging).
Somehow avoid
   If a defender does not have enough action points to dodge, but their
   dodging bonus is significantly higher than an attacker's melee bonus,
   they might somehow avoid the attack anyway.
You slice at the huge whirlwind of ice with your steel naginata but, although un
able to defend, it somehow avoids the attack.
   This effectively results in a defence that costs no action points. By
   using an insane tactics-attitude, a player with a sufficiently high
   dodging bonus may spend all of their action points on attacking but
   still somehow avoid attacks.
   Somehow avoiding is unique to having a high fighting.defence.dodging
   bonus. Fighting.defence.parrying and fighting.defence.blocking do not
   have this benefit. Note that you may somehow avoid even if you use a
   tactics-response of parry or block.
   On 15 Oct '21, Pit posted on a discussion about somehow avoid to say
   that this is essentially a bug, but that he was reticent to fix it for
   reasons:
 The existence of somehow avoids *is* a bug, and it's even trivially easy to fix
 (it's a 5-letter fix; I almost did it just as a routine fix before someone info
rmed me that doing so would kill off half the playerbase). You don't lightly cha
nge a feature that players have built their playstyle around.
   On 18 Oct 2021, the odds to "somehow avoid" was reduced by 5%,
   reportedly it was 100% before if you had a much higher dodge bonus
   against your opponent's attack skill bonus.
Spellcasting
   For the duration of spellcasting or hedgehog, the caster will attempt
   to dodge, parry or block incoming attacks as their settings specify in
   their tactics-response. Their chance of defending successfully is
   reduced, and they do not recover action points while casting.
Defend and riposte
   Defend and riposte are incompatible with dodging; if a player's
   response is set to 'dodge', they will be unable to perform either of
   these actions.

Block
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
          This article is a stub. You can help Discworld MUD Wiki by
          expanding it.
   "Block" is a passive defense which prevents an opponent from landing a
   blow in combat.
   It depends on a player's bonus in fighting.defence.blocking and
   controlled by the option options.combat.tactics settings (dedicated
   block users attack with one hand and block with the other). Holding a
   shield, along with the qualities of the shield and the skills of the
   attacker all factor into the success of a block.
   In addition to blocking attacks, the player also gains the absorb
   mechanic (or rather, holding a shield protects the user on an unknown
   level and acts like armour with unknown coverage, absorbs can be quite
   powerful but are vastly unknown as to what causes the ability to
   trigger.) Absorbs cost little to no ap and basically just add to the
   defense of the character.
   Block has yet to be tested extensively, or the people that have done
   the testing haven't shared it here.
   (Check "discussion" for notes from users about block as I'm trying to
   keep this page clear of theorycrafting, a good idea of block can be
   gotten from checking out the page on parry and checking the notes in
   discussion.)

   Parrying is the means of defence by which an the defender deflects an
   incoming physical attack with their weapon.

Applicability
   Parrying can only be used to deflect physical attacks, thus it is
   useless against magic.
   Parrying can be used to deflect either a melee attack or a ranged
   attack; if successfully executed then the defender takes no damage.
   In order to parry, one must be holding a weapon with tactics-response
   set to either 'neutral' or 'parry', or unarmed with the 'unarmed parry'
   tactics response option set. The tactics-parry setting must either be
   set to 'both', or to a hand the player is holding a weapon in.
   Note that parrying is not performed using a shield - see block for
   deflecting attacks with a shield.
Mechanics
   There are two factors associated with parrying:
     * How likely is an incoming attack to be parried?
     * How many action points does parrying an attack cost?
   These are addressed below:
Chance of parrying
   A character's basic chance of parrying an incoming attack is determined
   by a skillcheck of their fighting.defence.parrying skill against the
   relevant weapon skill of the attacker (eg. fighting.melee.sword or
   fighting.range.thrown).
   This chance is then modified by the following factors specific to the
   defender's parrying^[1]:
     * The weapon's weight vs. the wielder's strength. Essentially, an
       easily-carried weapon provides a bonus to parrying, while a weapon
       carried with difficulty incurs a penalty. Note that this check can
       be made more easy by holding the parrying weapon in both hands.
     * The weight of the parrying weapon vs. the weight of the attacking
       weapon. If your weapon is heavier than your opponent's, then you
       gain a (limited) bonus to parrying. If on the other hand your
       weapon is lighter than your opponent's, then you incur an unlimited
       penalty to parrying as conservation of momentum pushes your weapon
       away faster.
     * Certain weapons have inherent bonuses to parrying, such as the
       custom fencing blade from the Genuan Musketeers' Guild.  research
       If this has been marked on a page, it's because there was something
       that probably isn't known, that the person who edited the page
       thinks could be found out. Perhaps you could figure this thing out,
       and be famous evermore.
     * Axes have an inherent penalty to parry chance. There may also be
       penalties for other weapon types  research If this has been marked
       on a page, it's because there was something that probably isn't
       known, that the person who edited the page thinks could be found
       out. Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be famous
       evermore. .
     * There is a penalty to parrying in direct proportion to the degree
       of burden of the defender. It's hard to get your weapon in place in
       time when you're lugging a lot of equipment about.
     * There is a dexterity dependent penalty for parrying with a weapon
       in the 'off-hand'^[2]
Action point cost
   The action point cost of parrying starts at a constant base level based
   on your parrying weapon, and is then modified as follows:
     * The cost is reduced with higher skills in fighting.special.tactics
       and by winning the check of your fighting.defence.parrying against
       the attacker's weapon skill by larger margins.
     * There is a small bonus for parrying with both hands (because you
       only need to move whichever happens to be closest to the attack;
       this will be less far on average than with one weapon). It is
       almost always better to parry with both hands than just one.
     * There is an action point penalty for parrying with an axe. There
       may also be penalties for other weapon types   research If this has
       been marked on a page, it's because there was something that
       probably isn't known, that the person who edited the page thinks
       could be found out. Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be
       famous evermore. .
     * There is a diminishing-returns penalty based on the weight of the
       parrying weapon (the heavier it is, the more momentum you need to
       overcome after parrying). As with the chance to parry, this is
       reduced by holding the parrying weapon in both hands.
Defending
   Parry can be used (along with block, but not dodge) to defend another
   player. By this means, a player can attempt to parry blows aimed at
   another player, without exposing themself to risk in the same way that
   protect does. Note however that:
     * A failed parry results in the defended target getting hit.
     * Defending another player incurs a very high action point cost on
       the defender, which may well prevent them from defending attacks
       aimed at themself. Thus, defend is not entirely risk-free.
Riposte
   If a player is using parry as their defensive skill, then they can
   attempt to riposte an incoming attack - this causes them to attempt a
   special counter-attack following the next successful parry. The weapon
   must have a spike or point, as the riposte attack is pierce based.

Experience points
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Experience points (or XP) are a measure of how much a player has learnt
   from their experience. They are earned by various means - most
   significantly by killing enemies - and can be spent to increase levels
   in skills.

Gaining experience points
   There exist many ways by which experience points can be gained:
Kill and burial XP
   Kill XP is earned when a player kills an enemy, and burial XP is
   awarded when the corpse is buried. The amount of XP rewarded increases
   in relation to the 'difficulty' of the target killed.
   Note that:
     * You can only get burial XP once per victim - recovering the corpse
       and re-burying it does not award further XP.
     * You can only get burial XP within five minutes of the npc dying.
       Corpses buried after this time give no XP.
     * Even when npcs seem identical, they often give different amounts of
       kill and burial XP. E.g. three farmers in the melon farms outside
       Djelibeybi will give three different amounts of XP.
     * Npcs that don't leave behind corpses--such as zombies, vampires,
       mommets, eggplants--seem to just give kill xp.
   Kill and burial XP are related, but work somewhat differently. Kill XP
   appears to start out the same as the burial XP, but it's adjusted
   downwards in a few ways that burial XP is not:
     * If the victor is of higher guild level than the victim, then the XP
       is scaled down according to the ratio of their levels (eg. a level
       200 player killing a level 100 victim only gets half the XP that a
       level 100 player killing the same victim would).
     * The XP is scaled down in proportion to the victor's wimpy level (so
       a wimpy of 10% results in 90% of the XP being awarded, for
       example).
     * If the victor's XP rate is over 100,000 XP/hour, kill XP is scaled
       down, apparently according to the ratio of 100,000 to your rate (so
       that when your rate is 200,000 XP/hour, you'll get half the kill XP
       you normally would, and when it's 500,000 XP/hour, you'll get a
       fifth).
     * If the npc is in combat with you, but you are not actually in the
       room when it dies, you only get half of "your share" ("your share"
       being the amount you would have gotten if you had been in the room
       when it died and not grouped with other combatants) of the kill xp.
   Burial XP, on the other hand, is only penalized when your hourly rate
   reaches 500,000 xp/hour (as with most types of xp), apparently
   according to the ratio of 500,000 to your rate. Also, unlike with kill
   XP, if you're not in the room when the corpse is buried, you still get
   your share of the burial XP (although you only get your own share, not
   any shared burial xp from groupmates).
   There are several things you can do to get rid of corpses besides
   burying them normally:
     * Ritually bury: When you ritually bury a corpse, you get the same
       burial XP as usual--but at the same time, you get XP from the
       command itself. If you fail to ritually bury a corpse, you get the
       command XP, but not the burial XP--if this happens, you can still
       bury the corpse normally to get the burial XP.
     * In some rooms, such as on bridges, corpses that are "buried" show
       up in the room below. You get burial XP when you "bury" it this
       way--there's no need to go to the room below and bury it again.
     * Order creeping doom to devour: Ordering a creeping doom to devour a
       corpse is incompatible with getting burial XP from that corpse. You
       get no XP when it devours it, and it won't devour a corpse that's
       been buried.
     * Turn corpse into spectre: If you perform Unquiet Spirit to turn a
       corpse into a spectre, you won't get burial XP. You can, however,
       perform the ritual on corpses that have been buried and recovered.
     * Destroy with Withering Touch: If you perform Withering Touch on a
       corpse to destroy it, you will get burial XP. You can only perform
       the ritual on corpses that haven't been buried yet.
   It makes no difference whatsoever who deals the deathblow or who
   performs the actual burial. Even if someone who wasn't in combat with
   the npc buries the corpse, you'll get the same amount of burial XP.
Division and sharing of kill and burial xp
   When an npc is fighting multiple people^[1]--who are either in the same
   room or at most one room away^[2]--the kill and bury XP awarded by that
   npc will be affected. First, the kill and bury XP are divided by the
   number of people the npc is in combat with (again, only counting people
   in the same room as the npc or immediately adjacent rooms). Then, a
   small amount--perhaps 10 or 12 XP for two people--seems to be added.
   After any division that takes place, kill and bury XP are shared with
   groupmates as follows:
     * Up to half of each person's kill and burial XP is shared with any
       groupmates who are in the same room and less than five minutes
       idle. This sharing takes the form of giving free XP to your
       groupmates--your own XP isn't diminished by it.
     * If a groupmate's guild level is less than half of your own, you
       only share a fraction of your kill and burial xp equal to (their
       guild level/your guild level), instead of half.
     * You do share kill and burial XP with non-combatant groupmates.
       However, combatants will get more kill and burial XP overall, since
       they get their own share of the kill and burial XP in addition to
       shared XP from groupmates.
   Note that pets and fruitbats being in combat do cause the xp to be
   divided, but they don't share any, even with their owners or summoners.
   This includes moon dragons--despite the fact that as soon as they're
   attacked, they fly up to perch on your shoulder and so aren't involved
   in the combat beyond draining xp.
   The end result for the simplest case--where all combatants have the
   same guild level and are grouped with each other--is that each person
   gets half of solo XP, plus solo XP divided by twice the number of
   combatants, plus a bit (from the small amount that is added after the
   division, and then shared).
   Grouped combatants Approximate kill and burial XP for each combatant
   1                  100%
   2                  75%
   3                  67%
   4                  63%
   5                  60%
   6                  58%
   Since non-combatant groupmates in the same room will get half of their
   combatant groupmates' kill and burial XP shared with them, this adds up
   to 50%^[3] regardless of the number of combatants.
   It's worth emphasizing that this only holds true for that simplest
   case. More typically, group members will not all have exactly the same
   guild level, even if they are similar, so they will get different
   amounts of kill xp to begin with (and, of course, share different
   amounts of kill xp with their groupmates).
   Interestingly, groupmates with lower guild levels can raise the overall
   amount of XP you get from an npc, because their lower guild level
   causes them to receive more kill XP, which is then partially passed on.
   Totems and dust devils are a little more complex in the way they share
   XP. They will share up to half their kill and bury XP with their
   summoner, but only a quarter of it with the summoner's groupmates. So,
   for the summoner, they act as an extra groupmate, but for the
   summoner's groupmates they'll "drain" more XP. If one of these minions
   disappears (i.e. is dismissed or dies) before the npc dies, it won't be
   included in the division: it will be as though the minion was never in
   the fight. However, it if disappears after the death but before the
   burial, it will be included in the division of burial XP, but won't
   share any of the burial xp. It's therefore a good idea to bury before
   your minions disappear.
Command XP
   Nearly all guild commands give XP when executed. For the most part, the
   amount of xp they give is twenty times the amount of gp spent. However,
   if the gp spent is 5 or less (such as with value, or fueling a
   broomstick with 5 gp or less), no xp is given.
   This XP award is reduced based on how often the command in question has
   been executed and how many other commands have been executed in the
   meantime. Every time the player executes a command (or casts a
   particular spell/ritual), the MUD increments a count for that command.
   The counter is halved if the command hasn't been executed in the last 5
   minutes. The XP award is divided by (1 + count) if the count is less
   than 10, and is set to zero if the count is 10 or more.
   As of November 1, 2012[1], command xp is no longer shared with
   groupmates.
Heartbeat XP
   The simplest of all XP to gain, heartbeat XP is a uniform 3 XP per
   'heartbeat'--until your xp rate reaches 500,000 XP/hour, at which point
   it drops to 2 XP per heartbeat (and further drops when your xp rate
   reaches higher amounts). The heartbeat rate is approximately one per
   two seconds, though this varies in periods of lag.
Exploration XP
   Exploration XP is a small amount of XP  research If this has been
   marked on a page, it's because there was something that probably isn't
   known, that the person who edited the page thinks could be found out.
   Perhaps you could figure this thing out, and be famous evermore.
   awarded to a player whenever they enter a room that nobody else has
   entered for a while. You can get exploration XP from entering a room
   which already contains an npc or another player (although the other
   player presumably must have been sitting there for a while), and you
   can get it from entering a room you just looked into. For the most
   part, you get exploration xp from non-terrain rooms--rooms in cities,
   villages, etc. While you usually get no xp from terrain rooms, you can
   sometimes get small amounts on the roads in the terrains.
   Exploration xp seems to range from around 0 to 470 xp per room, with
   the higher amounts being rarer. It's unclear what determines the amount
   you can get; it may be random.
   Rooms don't seem to give exploration XP shortly after a reboot.
   There are achievements in the Exploration category for getting various
   amounts of exploration XP:
     * Achievement: Novice Explorer
     * Achievement: The Happy Wanderer
     * Achievement: Across The Universe
Mission and job XP
   Jobs, or missions, give varying amounts of XP and money, depending on
   the specific job. You can do them as many times as you like.
   Some jobs have a waiting period before you can get another one. With
   others, you can get another one of the same type right away (if it's
   available), but you'll get less XP and money from it.
   With sausage-making missions in particular, if the mission is done
   while grouped, the xp is split evenly among groupmates.
   Agatean family missions work differently. You cannot apply for a
   specific mission, but are assigned one randomly when you ask for a
   mission. You must be a member of the family to do missions for them,
   and you must wait half an hour between finishing (or failing) a mission
   before you can get another one.
Quest XP
   Quests give an amount of XP related to the QP value of the
   quest  research If this has been marked on a page, it's because there
   was something that probably isn't known, that the person who edited the
   page thinks could be found out. Perhaps you could figure this thing
   out, and be famous evermore. .
   Level XP awarded
   1     15000
   2     40000
   3     75000
   4     120000
   5     175000
   6     240000
   7     310000
   8     400000
Achievement XP
   Achievements give an amount of XP related to the level of the
   achievement, as follows:
     Level   XP awarded
   Minor     5000
   Small     15000
   Moderate  35000
   Large     75000
   Huge      155000
   Massive   627500
   Epic      1267500
   Legendary 2547500
   Mythic    5107500
Teaching XP
   Teaching another player skills results in the teacher being awarded the
   XP spent by the student raised to the power of 0.8 for each level that
   the teacher was able to teach without difficulty, reduced by 50% for a
   level where the teacher failed the teaching skillcheck.
Newspaper XP
   Writing articles for newspapers gives XP as follows:
     * The authors of the each article get 60000 XP.
     * The newspaper's editors get 10% of the total article XP, plus
       120000 XP; the editor XP is divided up between all the editors.
Resurrection XP
   Successfully resurrecting someone gives the priest a portion of the xp
   that the former ghost got returned. This seems to be equal to the xp
   returned to the ghost, raised to the power of .77 or .78. However, this
   xp is subject to penalties due to xp rate.
Spending XP
   Players spend their XP by increasing their skills, by one of the
   following means:
     * Advancing their skills at their guild.
     * Learning from another player.
     * Learning from themself.
   Advancing skills at the guild is significantly cheaper than learning
   from players. Learning from another player is marginally cheaper than
   learning from yourself; the cost saving is dependent on the ratio
   between your level and their effective teaching bonus.
   These graphs show the cost of advancing via various means:
                     XPlearn0 300.gif         XPlearn300 600.gif
   Cost of advancing 1 level
   (levels 0 to 300) Cost of advancing 1 level
   (levels 300 to 600)
Death and losing XP
   The only way to lose XP without spending it is to die. What happens
   next depends on how the player is brought to life again:
     * If raised, then they come back to life with none of the XP they had
       when they died.
     * If resurrected, then they will come back with a percentage of their
       former XP dependent on the Pishite's skills. This can be up to 75%
       of the xp they had when they died.
   Any xp gained while dead will be kept when either raised or
   resurrected. While dead, you can gain exploration and (ironically)
   heartbeat xp.
XP rate
   Your XP rate--or at least, the rate that is relevant here--is always
   your rate over the past hour^[4]--in other words, the amount of XP
   you've made in the past hour. Quest and achievement XP are not included
   in your rate. Heartbeat XP, exploration XP, kill and burial XP, command
   XP, resurrection XP, family mission XP, and XP from jobs are included.
   Your rate only seems to change while you're logged on, with time spent
   logged out not counted.
   The easiest way to check your xp rate is by checking your progress on
   any unattained achievements in the Numberchasing category. You may also
   be able to get plugins for your client which will tell you your rate,
   though some will show your average rate since you logged in or reset
   the plugin.
   There are several achievements related to your rate:
     * Achievement: Xp Grinder: 100k/hour
     * Achievement: Ex Peas 4 Me: 200k/hour
     * Achievement: Hey Pesto: 400k/hour
     * Achievement: Experiential Learning: 600k/hour
     * Achievement: Numberchasing Nirvana: 800k/hour
     * Achievement: Good Day: 1 million per hour
   Allowing a broader definition of "rate", there are also two epic
   achievements for gaining 5 million XP in a single session,
   during--respectively--a single Disc day or a single Disc night.
     * Achievement: Day Tripper
     * Achievement: A Hard Day's Night
XP reduction
   XP reduction is applied to all forms of income (though not in the exact
   same way for all of them): kill, bury, command, teaching, resurrection
   and even heartbeat XP. Income is reduced based on the total XP earned
   by a player in the previous hour (XP rate). For types of XP other than
   kill xp, no reduction is applied until a player's rate exceeds 500,000
   XP/hr; as a player's rate increases futher, the reduction is also
   increased. The formula for determining the percentage of your normal xp
   that you actually get for XP rates over 500,000 XP/hr is:-
XP percentage = 50,000,000 / XP rate
   So, for example, when your rate is exactly 500,000, your percentage is
   100%: you're still getting full xp. But if your rate is 750,000, your
   percentage is 66%: you're only getting 2/3 of the xp you normally would
   get.
   Kill XP is reduced earlier, when a player's rate exceeds 100,000 XP/hr.
   For it, the formula is:
XP percentage = 10,000,000 / XP rate
   So, when your rate is 500,000, you're only getting 20% of your normal
   kill xp.
The XP cap
   You can't carry an unlimited amount of XP: the amount you can have at
   one time is capped at thirty million. The way this seems to work is
   that if getting a chunk of XP would put you over the cap, you don't get
   any of it. For example, if you have 29,999,800 XP and you do something
   that would normally give you 250 XP, nothing happens. Therefore, when
   you get very close to the cap, you'll begin to stop getting XP for
   things. Given this, if your heartbeat XP is, at that time, 3 XP per
   heartbeat, you might stop at 29,999,98; 29,999,99; or 30,000,000 XP
   exactly.
   Even though you don't get XP yourself at this point, you can still
   share XP with groupmates. It appears to work normally, except that you
   share out of what you would have gotten, had you been able to, instead
   of what you actually got (0).
   It's generally a good idea to spend your XP far before you reach the
   cap, as dying at 30 million will cost you, at minimum, 7.5 million XP.

Footnotes
    1. ↑ Note that "people the npc is in combat with" can include: other
       players (whether grouped or not), pets, fruitbats, hired
       mercenaries, totems, and dust devils. (Skeleton warriors from the
       "Grisald's Reanimated Guardian" wizard spell are a special case,
       and don't seem to count at all: you can use one without any
       reduction in xp for yourself or your groupmates.) The calm ritual
       will cause the npc to stop fighting anyone who's not in the room,
       as well as the performer. Chant has a wider effect--it can also
       cause everyone in the room to stop fighting, though it is
       pk-checked. However, just "stop"ping fighting will not make the npc
       stop fighting you.
    2. ↑ Changed on December 6, 2015, and announced here.
    3. ↑ More precisely, 50% of the average of what each combatant
       groupmate would get from killing and burying that npc solo.
    4. ↑ Actually, the MUD appears to use the amount of xp you've made in
       the last fifty-nine and a half minutes or so--NOT a full hour--for
       your rate. The exact amount of time seems to vary somewhat, though.
       You can see this effect if you check your progress in a
       numberchasing achievement repeatedly about an hour after you gained
       some amount of XP, and see when that chunk of XP disappears from
       your rate. This does, however, assume that the achievements are
       tied to your rate as calculated by the MUD for other purposes, and
       that they don't have some separate system for calculating it.

Consider
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   The consider command attempts to measure your combat ability against
   that of a potential foe. As players get stronger, the command becomes
   less accurate, having to take into consideration many different
   factors.
   People and NPCs being considered will be notified of the attempt and
   may react. A common NPC reaction is drawing weapons, which also serves
   to make the command more accurate. A player may attempt to consider
   covertly, which can be used to consider without notifying the target.

       have been because I didn't have the skills to keep parrying an
       unarmed opponent.)
     * Switching from a twenty pound mail hauberk to a thirty pound
       jazerant didn't seem to make a difference in considers.
     * Unholding/holding weapons varies consider depending on a persons
       skills. For example, Imperial Guards will typically judge one or
       two notches lower until they draw their weapons. The same applies
       for the Hashishim in Djelibeybi.
     * There's plenty of room - tens of bonus - in which a meleeist will
       be quagmired in ambiguous 'about equal' territory.
     * Once upon a time, you could give items to NPCs. Once you gave
       enough stuff to them, they would consider easier. This likely
       coincides with the dex loss from burden or due combat penalties
       from burden. However, you can no longer do this but you may be able
       to plant heavy items on them as well such as hundreds of AM pence.
       This may have been fixed.
     * Another interesting oddity is that NPCs will sometimes consider
       differently Very briefly when they first appear, regardless of
       equipment. It may be that the stats/skills for the NPC have not
       been set yet.
   Don't forget consider covert for a way of TM'ing co.po and co.ca.pe as
   this has no skill prerequisites!

Hit points
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Hit points (also known as Health points or just HP) are a measure of a
   player's vitality. When the player takes damage by any means, they lose
   hit points. If their hit points fall below zero, they get a visit from
   he who talks like this.
Contents
     * 1 Maximum hit points
     * 2 Hit point regeneration
     * 3 Ways to recover hit points
     * 4 Viewing hitpoints
     * 5 See also
     * 6 External links
Maximum hit points
   HP to weight factor
   The maximum amount of hit points a player has is mostly controlled by
   their bonus in adventuring.health. There is also an effect from the
   player's weight.
   To determine a player's maximum hit point total, read off the 'weight
   factor' from the graph to the right based on the player's weight, and
   then apply the following formula:
Max HP = floor( (150 + 10 * con + 4 * ad.he bonus) * weight-factor )
Hit point regeneration
   The rate at which hitpoints regenerate is controlled by the player's
   constitution and strength stats, with a stronger emphasis on the
   former. Specifically, it is:
HP regen per round = rounddown(sqrt(200/9.8 * (4 * ln(con) + ln (str)) - 50) - 1
0)
Ways to recover hit points
          See also: Category:Healing
   Beyond waiting for them to regenerate, players can recover hit points
   via any of the following means:
     * Drink healing tea (restores health over time or blue water (instant
       boost).
     * Eat a chocolate sword or some foods.
     * Smell a healing rose (restores health over time).
     * Perform any of the following priest rituals:
          + Cure Light Wounds
          + Cure Medium Wounds
          + Cure Serious Wounds
          + Heal
     * Bandage with a strip of cloth.
     * Zap with an oak wand.
     * Heal with the blade of Soyin.
     * Relax in some hot springs or PK combat arena baths.
   Players can also use stat items to increase their constitution or
   strength stats, which may result in an increase in the natural hit
   point regeneration rate.
   Splint can be used when legs are broken to reduce damage done when
   walking and to mend your legs after some time.
   For most horse illnesses you can ask a witch for treat.
Viewing hitpoints
   Players can view their current and maximum hitpoints via the score
   command. If the player is in combat or otherwise in most situations
   where the player takes damage, the monitor will show up detailing their
   current and maximum hitpoints.
   Players can see approximately what fraction of their maximum hitpoints
   another character has by using the health command, or if grouped with
   that player, by using 'group status'.

Health (command)
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   The health command is used to gain a rough impression of how many hit
   points the target or targets have.
Contents
     * 1 Syntax
     * 2 Health levels
     * 3 See also

health all
   The "health wounded" syntax will only show you the health of living
   things who are at least slightly hurt.
Health levels
   The following table shows the relationship between the reported health
   levels and the target's HP:
      Health level                          Target's HP
   'In good shape'     Within 200hp of their maximum.
   'Slightly hurt'     At or over 50%, but not within 200hp of their maximum.
   'Not in good shape' At or over 20%, and less than 50% of their maximum.
   'In bad shape'      At or over 10%, and less than 20% of their maximum.
   'In very bad shape' Less than 10% of their maximum.

Burden
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Mudlib-semiconf.gif This page contains formulae or data from the
   distribution mudlib. The data has been partially verified as up to
   date. You can help by filling in research on the topic.
   A player's burden is a measure of how much difficulty they are having
   carrying things and moving around due to the encumbrance of their
   inventory.
Contents
     * 1 Burden calculation
     * 2 Effects of burden
          + 2.1 Dexterity penalties
          + 2.2 Picking up and dropping things
          + 2.3 Combat efficiency
          + 2.4 Buoyancy
     * 3 See also
Burden calculation
   Your burden is calculated as follows:
     * Add up the weight of all items in your possession, in all your
       containers.
          + Worn items count as half their weight.
          + Items held in one hand count as twice their weight.
          + Items held in two hands count as 1.5x their weight.
          + Shields still count as 1x their weight when held.
     * Determine your maximum carrying capacity as:
Maximum carrying capacity (lb) = 1.89 * (20 + strength + strength^2/5)
   This gives:
          + 8 strength: 77.112 lb
          + 9 strength: 85.428 lb
          + 10 strength: 94.5 lb
          + 11 strength: 104.328 lb
          + 12 strength: 114.912 lb
          + 13 strength: 126.252 lb
          + 14 strength: 138.348 lb
          + 15 strength: 151.2 lb
          + 16 strength: 164.808 lb
          + 17 strength: 179.172 lb
          + 18 strength: 194.292 lb
          + 19 strength: 210.168 lb
          + 20 strength: 226.8 lb
          + 21 strength: 244.188 lb
          + 22 strength: 262.332 lb
          + 23 strength: 281.232 lb
          + 24 strength: 300.888 lb
          + 25 strength: 321.3 lb
     * Divide the first by the second to get your burden level.
Effects of burden
   Burden has the following effects:
Dexterity penalties
     * 50-74% burden results in a -1 dex penalty.
     * 74-99% burden results in a -2 dex penalty.
     * 100-124% burden results in a -3 dex penalty.
   And so on. It's possible to get up to 200% burden by holding a box
   containing exactly your maximum burden's worth of weight in it, or
   (very temporarily) to 400% and higher by wearing very heavy custom
   armour and then taking severe strength penalties.
Picking up and dropping things
     * Your carrying capacity is separate from your burden.
     * Since wearing things halves their effect on your burden and holding
       things doubles it, the point where you're maxed out and can't pick
       up any more can be anywhere from 50% to 200% depending on how much
       of your stuff is worn or held.
     * You can only take something out or put something into bags and
       other containers that you're carrying if you've got enough "space"
       to carry another of it.
     * If your carried weight changes such that it exceeds 100% of max
       (for example, due to a loss of strength), then you will
       automatically drop items to reduce it below 100% again.
Combat efficiency
     * Burden negatively affects one's 'to-hit' chance with all weapons.
     * If fighting unarmed, then there is an additional 'to-hit' penalty
       from burden.
     * Burden negatively affects one's ability to successfully parry or
       dodge an incoming attack.
     * An additional penalty to dodging occurs if your burden is over
       twice your dexterity stat.
     * Burden increases the action point cost of dodging.
Buoyancy
   The more burden a player has, the more trouble they will have staying
   afloat while swimming. This can be counteracted somewhat by effects
   that increase a player's buoyancy, such as being a witch or wearing an
   aquamarine magick crystal or swim ring.

Pursue
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Pursue is a command that causes your character to follow another
   without their consent. The other character may choose to lose you. This
   will match your adventuring.movement.following.pursuit against their
   adventuring.movement.following.evade. Flying away on a broomstick or
   using Divine Hand will also break pursuit, as can using skillchecked or
   restricted exits (for example, exits into worshipper-only areas of
   temples, or Order rooms).
   It is also possible to suppress your ability to evade and lead on
   someone with the setting:
options combat suppress_evade=on
   Those who are being led in this fashion get skill checks to notice
   this.
   NPCs who use the pursuit command are fairly rare. Some--like
   cheetahs--only pursue if you attack them, while others--like Coffee
   Nostra hitmen, lynxes, yeti, and ice giants--pursue and then attack
   you. They may stop pursuing after some time has passed.
   Watchmen will also pursue, but even Captain Angua won't actually kill
   you.
Delayed pursuit
   Some npcs use another form of pursuit when in combat. This isn't the
   same as the command, and they don't follow you into the room
   immediately--instead, they enter the room they saw you go into after
   several seconds.
   Many npcs in cities use this.

Follow
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Follow is a command that causes your character to follow another. They
   must accept the follow request for you to start following them,
   although the options under "options auto follow" will let you
   automatically accept follow requests from everyone, from friends, or
   from group members.
   Unlike pursue, there is no skillcheck to continue following someone,
   and if they use Divine Hand or Visit you will go with them. However,
   you can't follow a witch on a broomstick, and if an exit is restricted
   (as with worshipper-only areas of temples) you can be left behind:
   following doesn't bypass the restriction. Similarly, if an exit is
   skillchecked (as with climb exits and swimming) it's possible to fail
   the skillcheck and be left behind.
   The "unfollow" command stops you following someone, and the "lose"
   command stops someone following you.
Groups and following
   If you're in a group, you'll automatically follow the group leader. You
   can also use "group follow <member(s)>" (or "group follow all") to
   follow other group members, and "group unfollow <member(s)>" to stop
   following them.
NPCs and following
   Typically, minions will automatically follow you--and you may
   automatically follow them upon summoning them. Pets, too, usually
   follow you, although they may get left behind if you use Divine Hand.
   Most other npcs will not accept follow requests; you'll have to use
   pursue or just manually go through the exits you see them go through.
   One exception is Khepresh of Hat, who will let you follow him and who
   periodically uses Visit. Another exception is the npc you must escort
   in Agatean family missions.

Armour
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   This page details the nature and mechanics of armour on the Discworld
   MUD. For our armour database, click here.
   A piece of armour is a worn item which protects its wearer from a
   certain degree of physical damage.

Damage protection
Factors
   Various factors affect the degree of damage protection afforded by a
   piece of armour:
     * Its condition - the better the condition, the higher protection it
       confers.  research If this has been marked on a page, it's because
       there was something that probably isn't known, that the person who
       edited the page thinks could be found out. Perhaps you could figure
       this thing out, and be famous evermore.
     * The quality of material it is made out of. Higher quality materials
       (for example, klatchian steel) provide more protection than lower
       quality materials (for example, wood), although they also tend to
       be heavier. Note that materials confer differing levels of
       protection against different attack types. For example, chainmail
       provides good protection against sharp, slashing attacks, but is
       rather poor against piercing or bludgeoning attacks.
     * The degree of enchantment of the armour - higher enchantment levels
       increase the protection provided. Heavier armour can benefit more
       from enchantment than light armour can.
   The vurdere command can be used to indicate a crude approximation of
   the degree of damage protection afforded by a piece of armour.
Defensive ordering
   Armour is one of the last defensive layers to be applied. Its effect on
   incoming damage is calculated after the following have been applied:
     * Endorphin's Floating Friend and Grammer Scorbic's Household Guard.
     * Dodge, parry and block.
     * Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator, Sorklin's Field of Protection
       and Mama Kolydina's Instant Infestation.
     * Major Shield and Minor Shield
   Armour's effect is applied before the following:
     * Chrenedict's Corporeal Covering
Coverage and layers
   Armour does not automatically protect a player from all attacks when
   worn - only the armour that is worn upon the part of the body that is
   hit has any effect. Hence, gauntlets will only protect the hands, while
   a mail vest will protect the chest, but not the feet. Many pieces of
   armour affect multiple areas of the body - for example, a Grflx scale
   protects the back, chest and arms.
   Multiple pieces of armour can be worn over a particular body area, but
   only as long as their 'clothing layer' does not clash with anything
   else worn over that area. For example, a chainmail coif and a steel
   helm can both be worn over the head simultaneously, whereas a close
   helm and a great helm cannot be worn together. The name of an item do
   not always match the layer slot that it actually fits in - for example,
   a chainmail miniskirt actually fits in the suspender-belt slot since it
   conflicts with those items, not the miniskirt slot. Also, some pieces
   of armour fit in multiple slots, such as the offler-headed mask, which
   counts as both a helm and a mask.
   You can see which areas a piece of armour protects by using the vurdere
   command on it. Alternately, you can see which of all your armour is
   protecting which body areas by using the coverage command like so:
coverage armours except jewellery
   It is necessary to exclude jewellery because for some reason they are
   considered to be armour by the parser even though they do not have the
   protecting capacity of real armour.

Clothing substitution
   However, since armour is very heavy, even with the lightest armour,
   which being made of leather gets to be extremely warming, it is
   possible to substitute some armour pieces for pieces of clothing for
   the purpose of testing layers.

Condition and durability
   As armour absorbs damage, its condition degrades. This makes it less
   effective in reducing damage and, in extreme cases, can cause the item
   to be destroyed if its condition falls to a low enough level.
   The degree of damage to the armour itself is affected by:
     * How much damage the armour absorbs from each attack - the more
       damage absorbed, the more the armour's condition degrades.
     * The material the armour is made out of, and its weight - higher
       quality and heavier armour degrades slower.
     * The degree of enchantment on the armour - more enchanted armour
       degrades slower.
   Damage to armour can be fixed by repairing it in a smithy,
   leatherworking shop or woodworking shop as appropriate to the material
   it is made out of. The condition of armour is apparent by looking at
   it, or otherwise by using the command 'condition <armour(s)>'.
Mechanics - damage absorption
   Mudlib-unconf.gif This section contains formulae or data from the
   distribution mudlib. This information may be several years out of date,
   so needs to be verified as correct. You can help by performing research
   to validate it.
   The following stages are used to determine how much damage is absorbed
   by a piece of armour:
Base armour class
   All armour has a base armour class versus the three damage types
   (blunt, sharp and pierce). This is, very roughly, the amount of damage
   that the unaltered armour will absorb from each hit, without taking any
   other considerations into account.
   This base armour class can be determined from the vurdere command as
   follows:
   Order    Vurdere     Base AC Average Base AC
   1     Terrible       0 - 3   1.5
   2     Amazingly poor 4 - 7   5.5
   3     Pretty poor    8 - 11  9.5
   4     Poor           12 - 15 13.5
   5     OK             16 - 18 17
   6     Average        19 - 22 20.5
   7     Good           23 - 26 24.5
   8     Very good      27 - 30 28.5
   9     Extremely good 31 - 33 32
   10    Excellent      34+     37?^[1]
    1. ↑ We don't know the maximum vurdere value for excellent or even if
       there is a maximum, which makes figuring out the average rather
       difficult. The average displayed is extrapolated based on a maximum
       of 40, which makes the last step twice as large as the others.
   It is unclear if there is a way to get more accurate AC than vurdere
   value.
Enchantment
   Enchantment increases the armour class as follows:
AC = Base-AC * (1 + enchantment/max-enchantment) + enchantment
   Because the maximum enchantment is related to the weight of the item,
   this means that enchantment has a very significant effect for heavy
   armour, and a lesser effect for light armour.
   To illustrate this, see the following table detailing the AC at various
   levels of enchantment for different weights, all for items that vurdere
   as 'Extremely good':
   Weight (lb) Maximum enchantment Base AC AC (4 steady but dull enchant)
   AC (7 bright enchant) AC (10 maximum enchant - radiant)
   5 16 32 50 (6 thaums) 65 (11 thaums) 80 (16 thaums)
   10 27 32 53 (10 thaums) 71 (18 thaums) 91 (27 thaums)
   15 38 32 59 (15 thaums) 79 (26 thaums) 102 (38 thaums)
   20 50 32 63 (19 thaums) 87 (34 thaums) 114 (50 thaums)
   Note that a fully enchanted item will always more than double the base
   AC of the armour.
Effect of strength of attack
   The degree of damage absorbed by armour decreases with stronger attacks
   (as they are more able to penetrate the armour), down to a minimum
   level of half the AC.
   The specific formula is:
Damage absorbed by armour (HP) = min(damage, max(AC / 2, AC - damage/10))
   Where AC is the total AC of all pieces of armour in the location being
   hit.
   Therefore:
     * While damage is less than AC / 1.1, all damage is absorbed.
     * While damage is less than AC * 5, AC - damage / 10 is absorbed.
     * Past that, AC / 2 is absorbed.
   Our fully-enchanted 20lb armour from the table above (AC: 114) absorbs
   damage as follows:
   Damage of attack Damage absorbed by armour Damage let through

   200              94                        106                47%

   400              74                        326                19%
   450              69                        381                15%
   500              64                        436                13%
   550              59                        491                11%
   600+             57                        543+               < 10%
   In summary:
     * While the damage is 103 or less, all damage is absorbed by the
       armour.
     * While the damage is 570 or less, 114 - damage / 10 is absorbed.
     * Past 570, 57 is absorbed.
Mechanics - Chance for armour to protect
   Mudlib-semiconf.gif This section contains formulae or data from the
   distribution mudlib. The data has been partially verified as up to
   date. You can help by filling in research on the topic.
   Armour can of course only protect the wearer if it is hit. The chance
   that an enemy will strike the body part protected by a given piece of
   armour is dependent on their tactics-focus. If they are focusing on a
   given body part, then they will always hit armour covering that part
   when their attacks are successful.
   For other focuses, the following table gives the chance that an attack
   will hit a given body area:
   Area  None-
   standard Used when the attacker is roughly the same size as you. ^[1]
   None-
   giant Used when the attacker is significantly taller than you (eg.
   giants). ^[2]  None-

Implementation
   Special abilities were added to the game on 12 April 2015, as described
   in this blog post. They boost your abilities in one area of combat, at
   the expense of another area.
   To learn an ability you need to meditate by a statue of a hero. There
   is usually some requirement to be able to learn the ability.
   To forget an ability, you need to meditate by the same statue again.
   The requirement to learn the ability must be met in order to forget the
   ability.
Locations
Ankh-Morpork
   The statue can be found southeast of the junction of Short Street,
   Heroes Street and God Street.
Sampson Ronius
(also known as)
 The Bodyguard
   Sampson requires sufficient health (hp) and the sacrifice of a shield
   (large metal worked, small and medium did not). The ability is to
   deflect damage and spend less energy when defending someone else. Only
   warriors can learn this ability.
Ephebe
   The statue can be found on the southeastern end of Hypothetical Road,
   at the junction.
Yo-lo
(also known as)
Beyond Insane
   "You can feel the voice of Yo-lo whispering secrets into your mind.
   Knowing these lessons, you will henceforth completely ignore defence to
   attack all out."
   Seems to let you use all AP (or not need any AP?) for melee,
   practically guaranteeing you can get your melee hits in against many
   opponents... however you will not even try to use any melee defence.
   You will not dodge, parry, or block. You will not somehow avoid. Every
   incoming hit will hit you/your shields/your armour. Fresh shields,
   and/or very heavy armour is recommended.
   Being shoved/tripped etc. still seems to prevent you attacking until
   you recover.
   Endorphin's Floating Friend will still block incoming hits as normal,
   and drain AP as normal, but the instant EFF drops, everything will hit
   you at once (just like when you have no AP when your EFF drops).
   Anyone can learn this ability, but it requires a minimum health value
   of around 3000 (2808 HP wasn't enough, 3000+ was). You can bypass this
   if you get enough stat boosts to push your HP up (it only cares about
   your current HP itself, not your levels in ad.health).
Sto Lat
   The statue can be found in the Sto Lat cemetery at the western edge.
Cas'leb the Merciless
   (also known as)
  The Dirty Fighter
   Requires 250 levels of fighting.unarmed.striking. The ability is to use
   knee attacks when fighting unarmed.
Genua
   The statue can be found at the junction of Genua Avenue and Dauphin
   Street.
Callus Tacticus
(also known as)
  The Focuser
   A sword needs to be sacrificed to the statue before you can acquire any
   skills. If the sword is regarded as too cheap the sacrifice will be
   rejected (e.g. a duan jian worth &&&&&&&&&&+18999 6,3,33Gf is too
   cheap, a colichemarde (from Rene's shop on Okra Avenue) worth
   &&&&&&&&&&+19998 6,6,66Gf is accepted). The ability is to be more

The Pacifist
   Requires a minimum guild level of 200. The ability is to defend
   yourself better at the expense of not attacking, i.e. it disables
   baseround attacks and gives you some unknown defense boost. You can
   still use 'special' attacks, such as stab, pierce, impale etc.
   After testing, the "defense boost" seems to be letting you use all your
   AP for defending and no actual damage reduction or added bonus.

* Name *
Special abilities - combat bonuses in your chosen speciality
* Description *
To encourage diversity in playing styles, there are a number of "special abiliti
es". These are talents which make you better at certain areas of combat. All spe
cial abilities are passive and do not require the use of commands. There are man
y aspects of combat which have an associated special ability, for instance: defe
nding other players, fighting unarmed or using particular tactics settings.
The catch, however, is that you can only have one special ability. Once chosen,
you can easily swap your ability for another.
Your current special ability is shown in your (verbose) score.
* Learning special abilities *
At various places on Discworld, statues of ancient heroes have been placed, alon
g with a plaque describing what special ability they were renowned for.
To learn a special ability, you can meditate at the corresponding statue. By med
itating at the same statue again, you will forget the ability. Alternatively, if
 you have a special ability and meditate at a different statue, you will forget
the first and learn the new one in its place.
Not all abilities can be learned by everyone: some abilities are limited to cert
ain guilds, or require specific skills, quests or achievements before they can b
e learned.

Wimpy
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
   Wimpying describes an automatic or involuntary departure from a combat,
   via the "backwards" exit by default. Wimpying is usually triggered when
   a player's health has fallen below a proportion of their maximum
   hitpoints. This level is referred to as a player's wimpy. Players and
   NPCs alike can wimpy.
Contents
     * 1 Setting the wimpy level
     * 2 Operation
          + 2.1 Advantages
          + 2.2 Disadvantages
     * 3 Forcing and preventing wimpy
     * 4 See also
     * 5 External links
Setting the wimpy level
   A player can set their wimpy level either by using the 'wimpy' command,
   or through 'options combat'.
   The wimpy level can be set anywhere between 0% and 30%, and is
   displayed in the score command. If wimpy is set to zero, then this is
   displayed as being 'in brave mode'.
Operation
   Whenever a player is hit and their current hitpoints are below the
   wimpy proportion, they will immediately and automatically attempt to
   leave the room. This has advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages
     * Wimpying temporarily puts the player out of harm's way, potentially
       allowing them to escape and recover if they take further action.
     * In periods of heavy lag, an automatic wimpy may allow a player to
       escape from peril whilst they are unable to manually intervene with
       any surety.
Disadvantages
     * Wimpy can be disorienting, as it causes a sudden and unexpected
       change of location; thus, it can sometimes be worse than a less
       timely, but better planned retreat.
     * Almost all NPCs will follow players who leave the room within a
       couple of seconds, thus the reprieve is temporary at best.
     * Some NPCs or players may pursue, in which case wimpy will not
       remove the player from danger.
     * Wimpying may be fatal in and of itself if the exits are trapped,
       enemies are waiting in ambush, or the exit taken is off of a sheer
       drop.
     * If you wimpy into a room with aggressive npcs, you can end up
       wimpying back and forth between the two rooms, making it more
       difficult to run away properly (as opposed to accidentally fleeing
       to the room you just left).
     * Awarded kill XP is scaled down in proportion to the victor's wimpy
       level (so a wimpy of 10% results in 90% of the kill XP being
       awarded, for example).
     * Wimpying interrupts rituals, potentially stopping you from
       passaging away, etc., at a vital moment.
     * Wimpy ends your combat when you flee, but does not affect those who
       are fighting you. A PK who is in combat with a mix of PKs and NPCs
       will die a real death if they wimpy from a PK and are then killed
       by an NPC. A player of over a year's experience gained in a 7 year
       period died their last death after running from an aggressive NPC,
       then taking unintended PK area effect spell damage which caused him
       to wimpy back to that NPC.
Forcing and preventing wimpy
   Targets can be forced to wimpy (irrespective of their actual wimpy
   level) by:
     * Performing the Fear, Horror, or Terror rituals on them.
     * (If outside) Performing the Agoraphobia ritual on them.
     * (If in combat) Allegedly, performing the Demoralise ritual on them.
     * Casting Sorsalsean's Seismic Eruption on the room they are in.
     * Intoxicating them.
   Targets can be prevented from wimpying by:
     * A warrior guarding exits against them.
     * A witch casting vines on them.
     * Casting Myrandil's Vicious Seizure on the room they are in.
   A failure to pull something from a black top hat can result in a
   feeling of paranoia which causes occasional wimpying.

Options
   From Discworld MUD Wiki
   Jump to: navigation, search
          This article is a stub. You can help Discworld MUD Wiki by
          expanding it.
   The MUD has a large number of options, most of which you can set with
   the "options" command.
Contents
     * 1 Auto
     * 2 Colour
     * 3 Combat
     * 4 Earmuff
     * 5 Input
     * 6 Mxp
     * 7 Output
     * 8 Personal
     * 9 Terminal
Auto
   This category deals with things you can do (or try to do)
   automatically. When left off, you're asked whether you want to do them.
     * Death: There's options to allow friends or anyone to directly
       perform Raise Dead or Resurrect with no restrictions. If set to
       off, for example to prevent someone doing it without your consent,
       you'll still have the opportunity to manually accept. The possible
       concerns are that Raise Dead does not restore the experience you
       had before dying and Resurrect returns vary by the performer's
       bonus in faith.rituals.curing.target.
     * Follow: Automatically accept follow requests. You can set this
       separately for everyone, your friends, and your group.
          + Leadbehind: Turning this on means that when someone or
            something (such as a pet or minion) is following you, they
            will precede you into the room instead of coming into the room
            after you.
     * Give: Automatically let people give things to you. You can set this
       separately for everyone, your friends, and npcs.
     * Show: Automatically let people show things to you. You can set this
       separately for your friends.
     * Teach: Automatically let people learn from you with "teach me
       <skill|n/max levels of skill|command> from <living>".
Colour
   This category lets you set colours for various events. You can also use
   the "colours" command to set these.
Combat
   This category deals with combat.
     * Monitor: Lets you turn your monitor on or off, change its speed, or
       change the way it looks.
     * Tactics: This sets the same options as the tactics command.
     * Suppress_evade: With this on, you won't try to evade someone who is
       pursuing you.
     * Weapon_warning: With this on, you'll get various messages about
       things that are making you more or less effective while you're
       fighting.
     * Wimpy: Changes the percentage of hitpoints at which you'll
       automatically flee. Synonymous with the "wimpy" command.
Earmuff
   This lets you block or unblock certain events so that you don't see
   them. You can also use the "earmuff" command to set these.
     * Events: This shows you what you're earmuffing and lets you earmuff
       or stop earmuffing specific things. If you earmuff something that's
       targetted at you (like tells or remotes), then if someone tries to
       use that command on you they'll get a message that you're
       earmuffing that thing.
     * State: You can choose to have your earmuffs on or off, or on for
       everyone except your friends.
   You won't be able to do things that you're earmuffing--for example, if
   you have shout earmuffed, you won't be able to shout.
   You can earmuff shout, the newbie channel, remote-soul, multiple-soul,
   multiple-tell, teach, tell, remote and multiple-remote.
   Remote-souls are souls from people who in a different room, and the
   "multiple" things are souls, tells, or remotes that are sent to
   multiple people at once.
Input
   These options deal with the parser and let you choose the editor you
   want to use.
Mxp
   These options deal with mxp.
     * Tags: Gives you clickable links for urls, or to chat on club
       channels on the talker.
     * Enabled: Turns mxp on or off.
     * Livingmenus: When enabled, names of living things that are in the
       room with you will show up as links which you can right-click to
       see a menu of commands you can use on them.
     * Objectmenus: When enabled, object names will show up as links which
       you can right-click to see a menu of things you can do with the
       object (this doesn't necessarily include commands specific to that
       object, such as "play" for a musical instrument).
Output
   This set of options deals with the way things are displayed.
     * Map: With this, you can choose to have a small map displayed every
       time you look or glance. You can also turn off colours for maps
       with "plain", or change the map from a visual one to a written one
       with "written". (Setting written to "on" will make it tell you
       about the exits and doors you can see, how far you can see in each
       direction, and what living things you can see in surrounding rooms.
       Setting it to "doors" gives you a version that eliminates exits.)
       Finally, you can cause rooms in the visual map to be clickable
       links or not with "mxp" and--when mxp is enabled for the map--cause
       the text and background colours to be switched with
       "reversecolour".
     * Accent: "Mangle" lets you see accents, while "unadulterated" turns
       them off.
     * Asciiart: Having this "on" causes ASCII art to be shown as-is,
       whereas having it "off" causes it to be replaced with a textual
       description. The default is to have it on.
     * Combat, htell, look, names, and score can all be set to brief or
       verbose here.
     * Hints: Sometimes the game will give you hints. Having this set to
       off will hide them, while having it set to "masked" will cause it
       tell you when you got a hint without showing you the hint directly.
       (You can use "hhint" to see them.)
     * Numbers: With this set to "descriptive", various score-related
       output will give textual rather than numeric information. By
       default, it's set to "numeric".
     * Prompt: With the prompt on, you'll get a character at the beginning
       of a line when you can enter a command. You can set it to a
       specific string (for example, "options output prompt=>") or to
       "off".
     * Shorthand: ?
     * Shortinlong: With this turned on, when you "look" (or move around
       with look set to verbose), the short description of the room will
       be displayed in brackets above the long description.
     * Skills: In "branched" mode (the default), output from the "skills"
       command will display as a columned tree. In "list" mode, it will
       display as a list with the full path for each skill, then the level
       and bonus.
     * Suppress_poll: With this on, you won't get informs about new polls
       when you log in.
     * Temporal_reality: Controls whether durations (e.g. by custom item
       traders and other NPCs) are given in Roundworld or Discworld hours.
     * Usercolour: ?
     * Vote_reminder: With this on, you'll get periodic reminders to vote
       for the MUD at a voting site.
Personal
     * Description: This can be used to set your description, and have
       your description automatically start with a pronoun (or not). The
       "describe" command can also do this (as well as letting you
       describe specific zones).
     * Timezone: Lets you set your timezone relative to GMT and give it a
       name so that you can see times displayed in your local time.
     * Birthday, email, home_page, location, and real_name change these
       things as they're shown in your finger information. They can also
       be set with the "chfn" command, and email can also be set with the
       "email" command. Email specifically can be set to only be visible
       to admin and creators, by putting a colon (a ":" ) a the beginning.
     * Ignore_explain: With this set to on, people you have on ignore will
       see the reason you specified for ignoring them (if you did specify
       a reason) if they try to send you a tell.
     * Tables_opt_out: When enabled, stops you from showing up on top ten
       tables.
     * Travel: When set to "journey", you'll automatically journey (moving
       through multiple rooms at a time instead of just one) in terrains
       when this is an option. When set to "walk", you'll move one room at
       a time unless you specifically choose to "journey" in a direction.
   The old "roleplaying" option has been replaced with "roleplaying
   immersive" and "roleplaying nonimmersive", allowing a more
   mix-and-match approach to roleplaying mode.
Terminal
     * Cols: Sets the number of columns to display at once--the width of
       your client window. This can also be set with the "cols" command.
     * Rows: Sets the number of rows that the MUD will display before
       requiring input to continue. This can also be set with the "rows"
       command.
     * Type: Sets your terminal type. This can also be set with the "term"
       command.
