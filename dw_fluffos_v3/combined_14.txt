=== Content from Scabbard ===
{{Weapon tables}}

When a weapon or shield is in a scabbard:
*You can "draw" it, taking it out of the scabbard and holding it at the same time
*You may be able to "hurl" weapons such as knives, daggers or darts from a scabbard at an opponent for a thrown attack (either during combat, or to initiate it)
*With some swords you can [[iai]], slashing the sword from its scabbard at your opponent, initiating combat at the same time.
*Weapons in scabbards will not be confiscated by Imperial Guards in [[Bes Pelargic]]
*If the scabbard is identified as a component pouch, rituals and spells that require the sheathed weapon or shield will automatically retrieve and return it as required.

You can "sheathe" a weapon to put it into a scabbard of the appropriate type (if you have one, and there's space in it) and "draw" to take your weapon out and into your hand. This seems to slightly damage the scabbard, so frequent use of aliases that make you sheathe your weapon, perform an action and then draw the weapon again will result in "wear and tear".

=== Content from Score ===

Use &lt;code>syntax score&lt;/code> to see the list for the various versions of &lt;code>score&lt;/code>.

==Score brief==
The &lt;code>score brief&lt;/code> command shows your [[hitpoints]], your [[guild points]], your [[experience points]] and your [[burden]] is a concise format.
*You can do &lt;code>brief score&lt;/code> to set this as your default version of score.
*To have everything brief, you can do &lt;code>brief all&lt;/code>.

Example:
 Hp: 2331(2331)  Gp: 433(459)  Xp: 1143225  Burden: 21%

==Score verbose==
The &lt;code>score verbose&lt;/code> command is a very useful command that gives you information about your character.
*You can do &lt;code>verbose score&lt;/code> to set this as your default version of score.
*To have everything verbose, you can do &lt;code>verbose all&lt;/code>.

===Normal Score verbose===
This shows your [[hitpoints|health]], [[guild points|guild]], [[social points|social]], [[achievements|achievement]], [[quests|quest]], and [[experience points]].
*The normal version of &lt;code>score verbose&lt;/code> also shows your [[guild level]], your [[death|deaths]], [[wimpy]] setting, [[burden]], [[alignment]], [[special abilities]] and [[age]].
*See the next category for the more immersive roleplaying output for &lt;code>score&lt;/code> that show less details.

Example:
{{Prebox|
You have 1110 (1110) [[hit points]], 167 (167) [[guild points]], 2 (684) [[quests|quest]] points, 7 (1063) [[achievements|achievement]] points and 81 (81) social points.
Your current experience is 35271 and you are level 42 in the [[Ninja]]; your overall rating is 10017.
You have died 0 times and can die 7 times before you are completely dead.
Your wimpy is set to 10%.
You are [[burden|unburdened]] (10%) and quite comfortable.
You are [[alignment|neutral]], worshipping no god.
You have the [[special ability]] to defend yourself better at the cost of not attacking.
You are 1 day, 3 hours, 59 minutes and 4 seconds old and have logged in 28 times.
}}

Some of this information can also be obtained in smaller pieces with more specific syntaxes:
*&lt;code>score align&lt;/code> or &lt;code>score alignment&lt;/code>: You are barely evil, and not worried about the approval of any deity at all. (The end changes if you worship a deity.)
*&lt;code>score burden&lt;/code>: You are [[burden|unburdened]] (10%).
*&lt;code>score age&lt;/code>: You are 1 day, 3 hours, 59 minutes and 4 seconds old and have logged in 28 times.

===[[Roleplaying (command)|Roleplaying]] score verbose===
Instead of the normal score you will get the following more immersive score output by doing &lt;code>options output numbers = descriptive&lt;/code> or &lt;code>roleplaying immersive&lt;/code> (this will also do &lt;code>earmuff on&lt;/code>).
*This still shows your [[hitpoints|health]], [[guild points|guild]], [[social points|social]], [[achievements|achievement]], [[quests|quest]], and [[experience points]].
*The statistics are given to you in non-numerical form.
*You will also lose all info on your age, [[achievements|achievement]], [[quests|quest]] points and [[special abilities]].

Example after setting &lt;code>options output numbers = descriptive&lt;/code>:
{{Prebox|
You are Sulvore a [[Ninja]] of the second rank.
You are in perfect health and you are full of energy.
By the luck of a coin, you might be able to learn something new.
You are [[alignment|neutral]].
You will flee when you are critically wounded.
You are [[burden|unburdened]] and quite comfortable.
[[Death]] has never visited you in a professional capacity.
}}

You can turn it off with &lt;code>options output numbers = descriptive&lt;/code> or if you used &lt;code>roleplaying immersive&lt;/code> you can use &lt;code>roleplaying nonimmersive&lt;/code> (this will also do &lt;code>earmuff off&lt;/code>).

==Score stats==
Shows your current [[stats]].
*If you did not [[rearrange]] and did not use the services of a [[retrophrenologist]] then all your stats will be 13.

Syntax: &lt;code>score {brief|verbose} stats&lt;/code>

&lt;pre>score brief stats
Con: 8              Int: 16             Wis: 13             Wgt: 82.5 kg
Dex: 12             Str: 18             Hgt: 177 cm         
&lt;/pre>

The verbose version also shows temporary stats modifiers. See [[stat effects]] for more details about those.
&lt;pre>score verbose stats
Constitution ... 8        Strength ....... 18 (2)   Weight ......... 82.5 kg
Dexterity ...... 12       Wisdom ......... 13       
Intelligence ... 16       Height ......... 177 cm   
&lt;/pre>

==Score fighting==
Tells you what (if any) you are [[fighting]] and your current tactics settings.
*When not fighting anything: &lt;code>You are not fighting anything!&lt;/code>

&lt;pre>You are currently fighting a pimply grflx adolescent, a messy grflx adolescent and a wise grflx mentor here.
Your current tactics are:
   Attitude       :   neutral
   Response       :   dodge
   Focus          :   none
   Attack         :   both
   Parry          :   both
   Unarmed Parry  :   yes
&lt;/pre>

If you entered into a fight with others but they are not in the same room as you, you'll get the following:
*&lt;code>You are currently fighting a pimply grflx adolescent and a wise grflx mentor (these are people you will auto attack on sight).&lt;/code>
*If you &lt;code>stop fighting&lt;/code> (or just &lt;code>stop&lt;/code>), then after a few seconds you won't attack anything on sight, unless they attack you (this doesn't prevent others to continue hunting for you).
*Some npcs will always attack you on sight. See [[dangerous zones]].
*The rest of the npcs will usually attack you on sight a bit longer than you are hunting for them, so if you wait something like 15 seconds after you normally (without using stop) are no longer hunting for them they should no longer be hunting for you either.

==Score quests==
Show what [[quests]] you have completed.

&lt;code>score quests sorted&lt;/code> shows what quests you have completed, in alphabetical order.

==Score achievements==
Show what [[achievements]] you have completed.

&lt;code>score achievements sorted&lt;/code> shows what achievements you have completed, in alphabetical order.

==Score temperature==
This shows the [[temperature]] of where you are, the impact of each thing worn on its own line (excluding items that have no effect), your overall temperature and how it is currently changing.
*You can also use &lt;code>score temp&lt;/code> for short.
*This is the equivalent of &lt;code>[[temp]] brief&lt;/code> or &lt;code>[[temperature]] brief&lt;/code>. Use &lt;code>brief temperature&lt;/code> to make this the default.
*To additionally show the clothes that have no impact on temperature, you can use &lt;code>[[temp]] verbose&lt;/code> or &lt;code>[[temperature]] verbose&lt;/code>. Use &lt;code>verbose temperature&lt;/code> to make this the default.
*You can use &lt;code>temp very brief&lt;/code> to get an even more brief report of the ambient temperature, the impact of your clothes, your overall temperature and how it is currently changing.

==Score relationships==
If you are not in a [[family]], you get:
 You're not in a family!

Otherwise you get a list of all your (immediate) family relationships, e.g.:
 Ptonya is your mother.

=== Content from Scour ===
 | gp = Depends on ritual
 | learntat = guild level 75
 | skills = [[faith.items.scroll]] for wards, None for other forms
 | items = [[faith rod]] or [[ward]] or [[remember place]]
 | guild = [[Priests' Guild]]
}}
The '''scour''' [[command]] allows you to remove a [[ritual]] from a [[faith rod]], or a [[ward]] or [[remember place]] from an item.

It can only be done at a [[high altar]].

Scour is learned at guild level 75 from your religious instructor.

==Syntax==
The syntax is basically the same for every type of scouring:
&lt;pre>scour {places|rituals|wards} from &lt;object>&lt;/pre>

==Removing wards==
You can use scour to remove [[wards]] from an item.  If the item has more than one ward, it will remove all of them.

When scouring a ward, there's a chance that the ward will trigger instead of just disappearing.  This seems to be more likely to happen when there are more wards on an item.

This usage uses the [[faith.items.scroll]] skill, and costs 50 gp per ward.

==Removing rituals from faith rods==
Scour can also be used to remove the rituals from a [[faith rods|faith rod]].  This will remove ''all'' rituals bestowed on a rod.

This usage uses 50 gp.

==Removing remember places==
Finally, you can scour a place from an object to make it stop [[Remember Place|remembering a place]] for you.  This is necessary if you want to remember a different place with the object.

This usage doesn't use any gp.

=== Content from Sew ===

''Note: Not to be confused with the [[Mend]] priest [[ritual]] from [[Gapp]].''

There are alternatives to mending clothes with a needle: [[Gapp's low altar]], [[Mending npcs]], the [[Mend]] ritual.

== Acquisition ==
The sew command is inherent to needles and does not need to be learned.  Needles can be found in various shops around the Disc, the most widely available for clothing being {{itemdb|636|a small silver needle}}.

Needles require thread to be used.  Commonly found in sewing supply shops, thread can be purchased by the spool in {{itemdb|1772|various locations}}.  Each spool contains a number of threads.  Threads can be wound on a spool using &lt;code>wind thread onto spool&lt;/code>. This currently turns silk threads on spools into cotton threads (see [[Talk:Sew|discussion]] page).

Commonly found in [[leatherwork]]ing shops, a {{itemdb|1817|heavy-duty needle}} and {{itemdb|3462|strong sinew thread}} can be used to sew leather items. Many other types of needles can be used for fabrics other than leather.

== Use ==
Each sewing attempt costs 25 craft [[GP]] and requires a thread.  The thread is consumed on either success or failure.

Now you don't have to pull the thread from the spool, you can thread directly from the spool!

New sequence, thread directly from the spool:
* &lt;code>hold needle&lt;/code>
* &lt;code>thread &lt;needle> from &lt;thread spool>&lt;/code>
* &lt;code>sew &lt;object> with &lt;needle>&lt;/code> or &lt;code>mend &lt;object> with &lt;needle>&lt;/code>

Old sequence, by pulling the thread first:
* &lt;code>hold needle&lt;/code>
* &lt;code>pull thread from &lt;spool>&lt;/code>
* &lt;code>thread &lt;needle> with &lt;thread>&lt;/code>
* &lt;code>sew &lt;object> with &lt;needle>&lt;/code> or &lt;code>mend &lt;object> with &lt;needle>&lt;/code>

Your bonus in one of [[crafts.materials.needlework]] or [[crafts.materials.leatherwork]] determines your success and how much the [[condition]] of the item is improved with a single attempt.

Failing an attempt to sew a severely damaged item with low skills may result in destroying the item.

=== Caution ===
There are known to be 2 spools of sinew thread for leatherworking in the game. The one with the description &lt;code>a spool of strong sinew thread&lt;/code> is known to be buggy and does not work. The one with the description &lt;code>a spool of sinew&lt;/code> is known to work. The correct one can be bought from [[Nicolette Leveaux]] in the basement of the [[Thieves' Guild]] in [[Ankh-Morpork]].

== Skills Used ==

*[[crafts.materials.needlework]] used for sewing all sewable fabric other than leather.
*[[crafts.materials.leatherwork]] used for sewing leather only

== Achievements ==
There are two achievements in the Crafts category related to this command:
* {{achievement|Stitched In Time}}
* {{achievement|Fear To Thread}}

== See Also ==
*[[Mending npcs]]
*[[Embroidery]]
*[[Quilting]]
*[[Mend]] ([[Gapp]] ritual)
*[[Gapp's low altar]]
*The {{itemdb|1768|pin cushion}} is a worn [[container]] that can store needles and pins.
