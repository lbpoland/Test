=== Content from Tactics ===

A player's '''tactics''' settings determine various options about how they will behave during combat.

These settings can be viewed and set using the 'tactics' command, and the options available are explained in detail below.

==Response==
A player's 'response' setting determines which of the [[fighting.defence]] skill subtrees they will use to defend themself.  It can be set to one of four options:
*'''Dodge''' - with this option set, a player will always attempt to [[dodge]] incoming attacks, and will not attempt to [[parry]] or [[block]] them.
*'''Parry''' - with this option set, a player will always attempt to [[parry]] or [[block]] incoming attacks (depending on whether the hand(s) specified in the 'parry' option below are holding a [[shield]] or not).  They will not attempt to [[dodge]].
*'''Block''' - with this option set, a player will always attempt to [[block]] incoming attacks.  They will not attempt to [[dodge]] nor [[parry]].
*'''Neutral''' - with this option set, a player will randomly decide to either [[dodge]] or [[block]] or [[parry]] each incoming attack.

Generally speaking, it is preferable to decide early on whether your character is more suited to dodging or parrying or blocking, and set your response to one of these accordingly - as attempting to gain proficiency in both response types requires twice the amount of [[XP]] expenditure.

That said, there is a ''minor'' bonus conferred in combat if a player's response is neutral, as the enemy isn't sure how the player will react.

==Parry==
A player's 'parry' setting determines which hand (or hands) a player will use to [[parry]] incoming attacks.  Obviously, this setting only applies if the 'response' setting above is set to either 'parry' or 'neutral'.

Available options are:
*'''Left''' - parry only with the left hand.
*'''Right''' - parry only with the right hand.
*'''Both''' - randomly choose which hand to parry with for each attack.  This confers a very slight reduction in the [[action point]] cost of parrying, but means that a player may find themself parrying with an unfavourable weapon.
*'''Unarmed''' - determines whether the player will attempt to parry when unarmed or not (each time this option is set it toggles allowing/disallowing unarmed parrying).  

Unarmed parrying may confer some level of protection to a parrying-dependent character without their weapons, but it can also be disabling if the player isn't skilled enough{{research}}.

==Attack==
A player's 'attack' setting determines which hand(s) are used to attack.

Available options are:
*'''Left''' - attack only with the left hand.
*'''Right''' - attack only with the right hand.
*'''Both''' - randomly choose which hand to attack with for each strike. This confers a very slight reduction in the [[action point]] cost of attacking, but means that a player may find themself attacking with an unfavourable weapon. 

==Attitude==
A player's 'attitude' setting essentially determines how aggressive or defensive the player is in combat.  This affects a number of things, as detailed in the table below.

{|class="wikitable" border="1"
 !'''Attitude'''
 !'''Extra GP drain per attack'''
 !'''Extra GP drain per defence'''
 !'''[[Action point]] limit for attacking'''
 !'''[[Action point]] limit for defending'''
 !'''To hit modifier'''
 !'''To defend modifier'''

 |}

The action point limits in the above table should be treated as relative to each other for the same skill level, rather than anything absolute.  Note that a player generally has higher action point limits for defending than attacking, as people are prone to avoiding pain.

The to-hit and to-defend bonuses are ''roughly'' equivalent to improving or worsening the chance to hit or defend by that much (but be aware that a great many other factors also influence this test).

Having a [[floater]] swoop will drain [[gp]] when defensive actions cost extra, same as [[dodge]], [[parry]] or [[block]].

==Focus==
A player's 'focus' option determines which part of the body their attacks will be aimed at.

Available options are:
*Specific parts of the human body ('''head''', '''neck''', '''chest''', '''abdomen''', '''arms''', '''hands''', '''legs''', '''feet''') - in which case all attacks will be aimed at that area.
*More general areas - '''upper body''' and '''lower body'''.
*'''None''' - just choose randomly.

See [[Armour#Mechanics - Chance for armour to protect|here]] for details on the likelihood of hitting various body parts if the 'upper/lower body' or 'none' options are selected.  If one of the specific areas has been selected, and the target is not humanoid, then the target area will be mapped onto a roughly similar area (eg. chest, abdomen, arms, legs, hands and feet might all strike the body area of a snake).

Setting focus to a particular area may be useful in that it can be used to get avoid [[armour]]ed areas on the opponent, or to hit more damage-sensitive areas (such as the face), however, attempting to focus on a specific area incurs a significant to-hit penalty:
*No penalty for focus 'none'
*Penalty ''very roughly'' equivalent to 25% chance to hit for 'upper body' or 'lower body' focus.
*Penalty ''very roughly'' equivalent to 0 to 25% chance to hit for focusing on specific areas, depending on how big the area is (bigger areas incur a lesser penalty).&lt;!--Chat: Yeesh, that's harsh!  You get a bigger penalty for focusing on the entire upper/lower body than a single area?!  Well, that's what the mudlib says, at any rate.  Anyone feel like doing some research to confirm this (and then submitting a bugrep)? -->

=== Content from Taskmaster ===
The '''taskmaster''' is the system by which the MUD compares skills, and determines whether or not to award a player a free advance (also known as a '''TM''') in a level as a result of using a particular skill.

A TM shows up in different [[colour]]ed text while playing (by default, yellow), and often contains the words 'You feel more able to...' or 'You learn something new about...'.  They are awarded randomly based on the difficulty of the task you are attempting, and are 'free' in that they cost no [[experience points]].  You can see any TMs you have acquired during a session by using the [[hskills]] command.

See the [[TM Project]] for the actual reported TMs.
==Noncompetitive skill checks==
There are two different types of basic skill check implemented on the Disc for ''noncompetitive'' skill checks - that is, those where you are being tested against a fixed difficulty, not someone else's bonus:

===Linear skill check===
&lt;!--Chat: Wiki people: This is directly emulated by Template:Ldep -->
[[Image:TM-linear-1.gif|thumb|200px|right|Linear skill check]]
A ''linear'' skill check tests your bonus in the given skill against a minimum and maximum bonus, with the following results:
*If your bonus is less than the minimum, you will always fail the test.
*If your bonus is greater than the maximum, you will always succeed.
*If your bonus is inbetween, then the chance of success is directly proportional to where your bonus is between the minimum and maximum.

An example may help illustrate this.  Imagine that you are attempting to light a fire by magical means, and that this involves a linear skillcheck with the following properties:
*It tests against [[magic.methods.elemental.fire]]
*The minimum bonus is 150
*The maximum bonus is 200

If your [[magic.methods.elemental.fire]] bonus is 100, you will always fail to light the fire, as your bonus is below the minimum.  If your bonus is 250, you will always succeed, as it is greater than the maximum.  If your bonus is 160, then this is 20% of the way between the minimum (150) and the maximum (200), hence you will succeed 20% of the time.  If your bonus is 180, then this is 60% of the way between the two, so you will succeed 60% of the time.

{{-}}
===Decay skill check===
&lt;!--Chat: Wiki people: This is directly emulated by Template:Edep -->
[[Image:TM-decay-1.gif|thumb|200px|right|Decay skill check]]
A ''decay'' skill check requires you to have a minimum level in a given skill, and then halves your chance of failure for each multiple of a set number of bonus points (called the ''half-life'') above the minimum.  Unlike a linear skill check, there is no maximum bonus for which you will always succeed a decay skill check - increasing your skills makes failure increasingly unlikely, but never impossible.

Again, an example, may help illustrate this.  Imagine that we are now attempting to extinguish the fire by magical means, and this involves a decay skillcheck with the following properties:
*It tests against [[magic.methods.elemental.water]]
*The minimum bonus is 100.
*The half-life is 50.

If your [[magic.methods.elemental.water]] bonus is 50, you will always fail to extinguish the fire, as your bonus is below the minimum.  If your bonus is 150, then this is exactly one half-life above the minimum - your chance of failure is halved once, resulting in a 50% chance of success.  If your bonus is 200, then this is exactly two half-lives above the minimum, so your chance of failure is halved, and then halved again - resulting in a 75% chance of success.  

{{-}}
==TMing skills==
The chance of TMing a skill is related to the shape of the skill checks above.  The basic idea is that you are most likely to TM a successful skill check when you are only just able to succeed - that is, your chance of success is low, but non-zero.  As your chance of success increases, so your chance of TMing per success decreases.  Your chance to TM per attempt is dependent both on your chance to succeed the attempt, and your chance to get a TM, given that you succeed.

===Linear skill checks===
[[Image:TM-linear-2.gif|border|200px|right|link={{filepath:TM-linear-2.gif}}]]
For a linear skill check, your chance to TM per successful skill check is:
*Zero if your bonus is less than the minimum.
*Zero if your bonus is greater than the maximum.
*Inversely proportional to your chance of success otherwise.

So, your chance to TM if you succeed is greatest just as you pass the minimum bonus, then falls off steadily to zero as you reach the maximum.  

Your chance to TM per attempt is greatest half-way between the minimum and maximum bonuses, and falls off to zero as you approach either limit.

{{-}}
===Decay skill checks===
[[Image:TM-decay-2.gif|border|200px|right|link={{filepath:TM-decay-2.gif}}]]
For a decay skill check, your chance to TM per successful skill check is:
*Zero if your bonus is less than the minimum.
*Inversely proportional to your chance of success otherwise.

So, your chance to TM if you succeed is greatest just as you pass the minimum bonus, then halves with each ''half-life'' worth of bonus after that.

Your chance to TM per attempt is greatest one half-life above the minimum bonus, and falls off to zero as you approach the minimum or increase your bonus above one half-life.

{{-}}
===TM types===
The total chance to TM a skill across all bonuses is scaled according to the type of action being performed, as follows:

{|class="wikitable" border="1"
 !'''Type of skill check'''
 !'''Details'''
 !'''Example'''
 !'''TM chance scaling'''

==Competitive skill checks==
[[Image:TM-compet-1.gif|thumb|200px|right|Chance to succeed against an opponent with 150 bonus (zero modifier)]]
''Competitive'' skill checks are checks of one player or NPC's bonus against another's.  For example, attempting to hit an enemy with a sword might involve a skill check of your [[fighting.melee.sword]] bonus against their [[fighting.defence.parrying]] bonus.

The chance of success in a competitive skill check is initially based on the ratio of the offensive to defensive bonuses, as follows:
*If the offensive bonus is greater than the defensive, then the %chance of success is 50 * ''off_bonus''/''def_bonus''.
*Otherwise, the %chance of success is 100 - 50 * ''def_bonus''/''off_bonus''

At this point, the basic consequences of the above are that:
*The attacker has a 0% chance of success if their bonus is half the defender's.
*The attacker has a 50% chance of success if their bonus is equal to the defender's.
*The attacker has a 100% chance of success if their bonus is twice the defender's.
*Note that this chance may be less than 0% or greater than 100% at this point, if the attacker's bonus is more than twice the defender's bonus or vice-versa. 

The chance may then have a ''modifier'' applied to it by various factors associated with the skillcheck.  For example, there are to-hit modifiers in combat that depend on varying factors ranging from the weight of the weapons to each party's [[tactics#Attitude|tactics-attitude]].

Finally, there is always a chance that either player will succeed, irrespective of their skills.  Hence, the chance of success is capped at a maximum of 99% and a minimum of 1% (this also deals with 'impossible' percentages that are still less than 0% or greater than 100% at this point).

The chance of TMing from a competitive skillcheck is only applied to whoever wins the check, and is treated as equivalent to a non-competitive skillcheck against the opponent's bonus (with appropriate TM type and modifiers as above).

{{-}}

==Shared TMs==
If you are in a [[Groups|group]] with someone and in the same room, you can sometimes share a TM with them--in other words, they'll TM a skill and you'll learn something by watching them. 

The chance of sharing someone else's TM is ''approximately'':

{{Prebox|%chance to share {{=}} 25000 / (500 + diff&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup> + sqrt(level))}}

Where:
*''Diff'' is the difference between their level and your level in the appropriate skill, OR the difference between their bonus and your bonus in that skill - whichever is greater.
*''Level'' is ''your'' level in the skill that was TMed.

Basically, you're more likely to share someone's TM if you're near the same level/bonus as the person you were watching in the TMed skill, and you're more likely to TM the lower your level in that skill.

Note that language, [[adventuring.perception]] and any [[guild points|points]] skill TMs are not shared.

==Inspired==
If you are in a [[Groups|group]] and in the same room as someone who gains a TM, you may also be 'inspired' by their success.  This displays in the same colour as a TM and contains the key word 'inspire' but does not grant you the level.

Instead it dramatically increases your own chance of TMing that skill for a short period of time.

==Related achievments==
There are several tm-related achievements in the [https://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/secure/achievements.c?category=lucky Lucky] category:
* '''Scrounger''' and '''Good Friend''', for shared TMs
* '''Very Fortunate''', for tming skills over level 300
* '''Lucky Bugger''', for tming skills over level 500
* '''Jammy Bugger''', for tming skills over level 800

=== Content from Teachers ===

== Learning skills ==
=== From players ===
The teacher's bonus (ETB - Effective teaching bonus) has to be higher than your bonus for you to learn from them at all.  Their effective teaching bonus is the average of their bonus in the skill and their bonus in the relevant teaching skill (up to twice the bonus in the taught skill). For example, if a teacher has a bonus of 200 in [[people.teaching.magic]] and 400 in [[magic.spells.offensive]] (ma.sp.of), their ETB in ma.sp.of will be (200 + 400) / 2 = 300. As long as the student has less than this bonus in ma.sp.of, they will be able to learn that skill from the teacher.

Teaching cost is based on your level, your bonus (on unmodified stats), and the teacher’s ETB. If a teacher's ETB is at least the greater of either your bonus + 200 levels or your bonus multipled by 1.5, then they will show up as optimal when typing &lt;code>teachers list [the skill you want to learn]&lt;/code> and will give you the best possible XP cost for your skills.

A teacher can find their teaching bonus in a skill with:
 teach bonus &lt;skill>

To learn a skill from a player, the syntax is:
 teach me &lt;skill|n/max levels of skill> from &lt;living>
If they have autoteach on, this will make them automatically offer to teach you the skill.  This will show you how much xp it will cost, or will tell you that you don't have enough [[xp|experience]]. (Note that the xp isn't actually spent yet.)  Follow it up with:
 learn &lt;skill> from &lt;living>

Specifying the skill without specifying the number of levels will have them offer to teach you one level.  The "teach me max &lt;skill> from &lt;living>" version will have them offer to teach you as many levels as you can learn with the amount of [[xp]] you have.

You can also "teach me &lt;skill|n/max levels of skill> from all", which will cause everyone in the room with autoteach on to offer to teach you that skill.

=== From yourself ===
To self-teach, the syntax is:
 teach &lt;skill|n/max levels of skill> to me 
This will show you how much xp it will cost, or will tell you that you don't have enough [[xp|experience]]. (Note that the xp isn't actually spent yet.)  Follow it up with:
 learn &lt;skill> from &lt;living>

You can't self-teach commands.

== Learning commands ==
=== From players ===
To learn a command from a player, the syntax is:
 teach me &lt;command> from &lt;living>
If they have autoteach on, this will make them automatically offer to teach you the command.  Follow it up with:
 learn &lt;command> from &lt;living>

You can also "teach me &lt;command> from all", which will cause everyone in the room with autoteach on to offer to teach you that command.

It doesn't cost xp to learn a command.

=== From NPCs ===
To query a guild teacher about new commands say:
 say teach me please
At least some teachers do not respond to some languages. If the teacher doesn't respond check that you're asking in the language of the area where the teacher is located.

Guild teachers typically only teach commands to members of their guild.

== Causes for failure ==
* Insufficient skills: you can't learn a skill from someone whose effective teaching bonus isn't higher from yours.  You also can't learn a command from them unless you have the prerequisite skills and they have high enough skills to teach you.
* Busyness: Someone can't teach you if they're busy.  If you get a message that they're too busy, wait until they finish whatever commands they're doing.
* Idleness: Someone can't teach you if they've been idle for five minutes or more.
* Moving rooms: Teaching will be interrupted if you're no longer in the same room with them (in this case the xp is not spent).
* No autoteach: If someone doesn't have autoteach on, then in order to learn from them, they have to actively offer to teach you the skill or command.

== Finding a teacher ==
You can find a player teacher online that can be most optimal for teaching you a certain skill by typing &lt;code>teachers list [skill]&lt;/code>. You can then message that player teacher to learn from them.

Many teachers also put their skills on [[#External links|player-run sites]]. Some also put skill bonuses in their finger information.

If you want to learn from a particular person who isn't online, a good plan is to add them as a friend (with "friend add &lt;friend>") and then turn your friend inform on ("inform friend").  This will cause you to get a message when they log on or off.

== Becoming a teacher ==
You can become a player teacher by typing &lt;code>teachers opt in&lt;/code> which will make you show up when other players type &lt;code>teachers list [skill]&lt;/code>.

As well, you can set '''options personal teaching_spec''' to the skill tree (like fighting or magic) you wish to specialise to teach by typing &lt;code>options personal teaching_spec [skill tree]&lt;/code>. 

A specialisation can be changed every 5 minutes

[[Category:Guides]][[Category:Concepts]]

=== Content from Tell ===

It is an out-of-character command that is invisible to anyone not involved in the tell.  You can send a tell to someone regardless of whether they're in the same room.

If someone is more than five minutes [[idle]] when you send them a tell, or if they're [[afk]], you'll get a message informing you of this.

==Syntax==
&lt;pre>tell &lt;player> &lt;message>
tell &lt;player> [@adverb] &lt;message>&lt;/pre>
The first syntax is the simplest and most common.  It simply sends a message to one person, unadorned.  They see something like this:
&lt;pre>Player tells you: This is a message.&lt;/pre>

The second syntax lets you add an adverb.
&lt;pre>>tell player @quietly This is a message.
You quietly tell Player: This is a message.&lt;/pre>

===Multitells===
&lt;pre>tell &lt;players> &lt;message>
tell &lt;players> [@adverb] &lt;message>&lt;/pre>

Multitells work similarly to tells, except that you specify a list of players instead of one player.  The names on the list must be separated by commas, but no spaces, like so:
&lt;pre>tell alice,bob,carol This is a message.&lt;/pre>

Any individual who is not logged on, or who is earmuffing multitells, will be left out and the message will just go to everyone it can.  Usefully, this makes it so that you can make an alias to send a "multitell" to every one of a player's [[alt]]s (if you know them), and the alias will end up just sending a tell to whichever one of their characters is actually logged on.

You can't send multitells if you're earmuffing them yourself (although it still works if it's only actually ''going'' to one person).

===Tell reply===
&lt;pre>tell replylock remove
tell replylock reply
tell replylock &lt;player>
tell {reply|r} &lt;message>&lt;/pre>

Tell reply is used to send a tell to the last person who sent ''you'' a tell.  You can use tell replylock to make sure that tell reply will send tells to a specific person or people, so that it won't cause mischats if someone else sends you a tell when you're in the middle of a conversation.

==Blocking tells==
You can [[earmuff]] tells--or, separately, multiple-tells--either from everyone, or from everyone except [[friends]].

Being in [[Roleplaying (command)|roleplaying mode]] will also block tells.

Finally, having a specific person on [[ignore]] will block tells from them.

=== Content from Temperature ===

Temperature is also a factor that requires characters to wear appropriate clothing for the environment if they want to avoid the penalties (that can include [[death]]) of being too warm or too cold.

Due to changes&lt;ref>[https://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/blog/blog.c?action=filter&amp;blog=recent%20developments&amp;id=581 Developer Blogs: Recent Developments: Hot Stuff, posted on Sat Apr 4 14:39:58 2015]&lt;/ref> instituted on April 4th, 2015, some or all of the information relating to the heating / cooling properties of clothing may need to be researched anew.

__TOC__

{{Mudlib caveat|scope=page|status=unconfirmed}}

Comments in the distribution mudlib mention that a temperature of 0 is about 20 degree Celsius in order for calculations to be relative to the optimal human body temperature. It is likely that this doesn't hold true everywhere since in some tables 0 is considered cold and ~20 is normal.

==Environment temperature==
Depending on [[geography]], [[seasons]] and [[weather]], outside rooms can vary greatly from being unbearably hot in the desert in summer to insanely cold in the [[Ramtops]] in winter. Temperature inside structures can also be very hot (smithies and forges) or very cold (freezer in the butcher's guild) but it tends to be stable and not to vary without magical or divine influence.

The [[Description line (room)#Weather|weather line]] in outdoor room description is composed as follows:
&lt;pre>
It is &lt;a/an> &lt;temperature> &lt;season>'s &lt;period of day> with &lt;wind>, &lt;cloud cover> and &lt;precipitation>.
&lt;/pre>


The following messages are thought to be used both for the [[temperature]] command and the room's [[Description line (room)#Weather|weather line]].

However, it seems that messages obtained from these two sources do not always match. Perhaps your ambient temperature as reported by the [[temperature]] command is subject to other factors, or there is a time delay before one affects the other or quantum.

{| class="wikitable"

|-

|-
| > 50 ||incredibly, unbelievably hot
|}

==Worn objects and other effects==
Objects that can be worn can be warming or cooling or have no impact.

Items that are not worn do not normally influence your temperature. Some items might still have an effect because of [[magic]].

The degree of cooling or warming produced by an object should be determined by [[material]] and the areas covered.
:Custom clothes should show this most strongly, while regular objects, being created one at at time might differ.

The various messages give by temperature-affecting items are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Temperature ||Your &lt;object> provides
|-
| &lt; -18 ||an enormous amount of cooling
|-
| -18 ... -9 ||a large amount of cooling
|-
| -8 ... -4 ||a moderate amount of cooling
|-
| -3 ... -2 ||a small amount of cooling
|-
| -1 ||a tiny amount of cooling
|-
| 0 ||little or no effect
|-
|1||a tiny amount of warmth
|-
|2 ... 3 ||a small amount of warmth
|-
| 4 ... 8 ||a moderate amount of warmth
|-
| 9 ... 18 ||a large amount of warmth
|-
| > 18 ||an enormous amount of warmth
|}

There will be an "overall" message after all of these, as well, for the total amount of warmth or cooling your clothes provide.  Other warming or cooling effects can show up here, too:
*If you're wet: "... and you are wet".
*If you're under the effects of [[Warm]] or [[Cool]]: "...and you are being {warmed|cooled} by the power of &lt;deity>".
*If you're wearing an [[elegant ring]]: "...and your temperature is being stabilised by a spinning elegant ring".

===Material===

Some items change their impact based on the temperature of the environment {{research}} while others stay the same.
:Most linen and silk clothes provide cooling, but only in warm environments. The warmer the environment, the more they will cool. If the temperature is not warm, they will have no effect. They will not bring you to a temperature lower than "quite comfortable." Their cooling will only compensate for environmental heat and not armor or other clothing heat. If you have more silk than is required to reach an ideal temperature, the cooling will be shared among the items, and the reported cooling will be lower per item.
:Togas of any material from [[Linze the tailor]] and '''thick silk''' clothing from [[Nicolette]] provide either warmth or cooling based on the environment.
:Metal [[armours]] are warming when the room is hot, but have little or no effect when it is warm or colder, thus they do not help to bring you to a reasonable temperature.
:Other materials grant the same amount of warmth regardless of ambient temperature. Wool, fur, rubber, and latex are warmer than most other materials.

All normal clothes made of linen or silk that do not have a reason to be warming should probably be cooling. If they do not cool and it seems like an oversight, especially when found in very warm areas, they could be reported in bug reports for consideration.

===Areas===

The larger and more numerous the areas an object covers, the greater impact it should have on temperature.

Based on the weight of plate [[custom armour]] made of klatchian steel, these are the theorized relative dimensions covered for each zones:
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
!Zone !!Factor
|-
|head face hair ||2
|-
|neck ||1
|-
|hands ||1
|-
|arms ||3
|-
|chest ||4
|-
|back ||3
|-
|abdomen ||3
|-
|legs ||6
|-
|feet ||2
|}
Since there are no pieces of plate custom armour that only covers one of head, face and hair how they are broken down is not yet known.
:The coifs covers the head, hair and neck and thus should be able to determine the relative size of the face.

==Variation==
How your temperature is varying is also described by the temperature command:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Intensity ||You &lt;change>
|-
| &lt; -50 ||are freezing fast
|-
| -50 ... -21 ||are cooling down quickly
|-
| -20 ... -11 ||are cooling down
|-
| -10 ... -6 ||are cooling down slowly
|-
| -5 ... 5 ||will stay pretty much as you are
|-
| 6 ... 10 ||are warming up slowly
|-
| 11 ... 20 ||are warming up
|-
| 21 ... 50 ||are warming up quickly
|-
| > 50 ||are cooking rapidly
|}

==Effects==
*Characters who are hot for too long will suffer from [[heatstroke]], causing [[stat loss]] of [[intelligence]] and [[wisdom]], then [[death]].
*Characters who are cold for too long will suffer from [[hypothermia]], causing [[stat loss]] of [[constitution]] and [[strength]], then [[death]].
*Being too cold and [[wet]] can make you catch a [[cold]].

==Temperature regulation==
The following measures can help you keep your body temperature comfortable.
*Wearing warm clothes (wool, cotton, leather, etc.) or cooling clothes (linen or silk).
*[[Priests]] are able to perform [[Cool]] or [[Warm]] to make someone's temperature change.
*[[Followers]] of [[Gapp]] or [[Hat]] can perform [[Cool]] or [[Warm]] respectively.
*[[Wizards]] can make [[elegant ring]] with the spell [[Gillimer's Ring of Temperate Weather]]. The ring encases you in a bubble that maintains the body temperature of the wearer at the moment the ring started to be worn.
*Wizards can cast [[Patient Taming of the Quantum Weather Butterfly]] to make a room warmer or colder.
*Staying in temperate rooms, mostly inside since outside rooms vary with the [[weather]] and [[seasons]], is of course very efficient if possible.
*According to the [[distribution mudlib]], drinking when hot cools you and eating when cold warms you.{{research}}

[[Category:Concepts]]

=== Content from TM_Project ===
A while back a thief by the name of Sprynx DeNightshade created the original TM Project as a resource on how to TM every skill at every bonus.  Sadly that site only exists (in fragments) on the Wayback Machine and in the minds of players now.  

The following pages have been recreated by Danduin and others to bring this, in many people's mind, valuable resource back to life.  It is my hope that many people contribute to it and make it as great as its potential.  In the words of Sprynx, shamelessly stolen; I am a thief after all... Great thanks to any and all players who include their TM's, making this page continuously better and better.  

I do not have any contact information for Sprynx so I was not able to ask permission for all this, if you are out there contact me.

=== The Skill Tree ===
The following are the different skill trees. For each end skill you can get TMs if it does something in game. There's also [[shared TMs]].

=== Content from Track ===

 |skills=[[crafts.hunting.tracking]]
 |items=None
 |guild=Warrior
}}

Track is a command which allows you to attempt determine if, when and which direction a player or unique NPC passed through a room.

==Command details==
The track command requires 25 levels of [[crafts.hunting.tracking]] to learn, and is usually taught by other players or some guild NPCs.

Track is only available to warriors, and is [[pk-checked]] - NPKs cannot track PKs. Both players and NPCs may only be tracked if they are currently on the Disc--players must be logged on and npcs must be alive.

Each tracking attempt costs 9 craft GP.

Your bonus in [[crafts.hunting.tracking]] checked against your target's [[crafts.hunting.tracking]] bonus determines your success.  Other factors also influence your success - how long ago your quarry passed through the room, their [[covert]] abilities, the type of terrain, the use of hidden exits, the number of people who have passed through the room since, etc.

A successful track will give you the exit via which your target left the room, and an indication of how long ago they did so.  Tracking somebody who left a room via unusual means (e.g. flying, portalling or passaging) will result in the trail for the person ending in that room.

Failing a track may result in a false positive.

==Track message timings==
Depending on how much time has passed since your quarry passed through, you will get different timing messages  from the track command. e.g. "You inspect your surroundings and have few doubts that &lt;target> went &lt;direction> &lt;timing message indicating how long ago>. The timing messages and timings are below:

- An instant ago &lt; 10 seconds

- just moments ago &lt; 30 seconds

- a very short time ago &lt; 1 minute

- A short while back &lt; 2 minutes

- very recently &lt; 3 minutes

- recently &lt; 5 minutes

- Not very recently &lt; 10 minutes

- An Appreciable While Ago &lt; 20 minutes

- In the recent past &lt; 40 minute

- A long time back &lt; 80 minutes?

- A very long time ago -> ?

==Usage tips==
*Save GP by only tracking at intersections once you're on the trail.  If you lose the trail, check buildings since the previous intersection, or re-track the previous intersection.
*If you lose the trail at a high-traffic intersection, try tracking down the streets leading from the intersection to pick the trail up once more.
*To lose a tracker, try techniques such as passing through high traffic areas, sneaking, using hidden exits, going through water, etc.  Or advance tracking or fly/portal/passage.
