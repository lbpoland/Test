=== Content from Shields ===

The '''shields''' command can be used by a player to list any [[:Category:Arcane shielding|arcane shielding]] about themself.

If the player is grouped, they can use 'group shields' to list the arcane shielding in use by members of the group.

In addition to detailing which arcane shields are present, this command also reveals the following information about specific shields:
*[[Chrenedict's Corporeal Covering]] - the approximate number of layers left
*[[Grammer Scorbic's Household Guard]] and [[Endorphin's Floating Friend]] - Exactly which items are floating in orbit, and what [[condition]] they are in.
*[[Heezlewurst's Elemental Buffer]] - the type of energy protected against.
*[[Major Shield]] and [[Minor Shield]] - the approximate amount of time the protection will last.
*[[Mama Kolydina's Instant Infestation]] - the [[insects|type of bugs]] present, and a rough indication of how many there are.
*[[Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator]] and [[Sorklin's Field of Protection]] - the current impact shield colour.

==Types of arcane protection==
*[[Priest]]
: * You are covered with a protective aegis. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Holy Aegis]])
: * You are {barely protected|protected|really protected|perfectly protected} by the {power|grace} of &lt;deity>. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Minor Shield]] or [[Major Shield]])
: * You are protected by the protective aura of &lt;priest>. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Security Blanket]])

*[[Witch]] (or [[magick crystal]])
: * The air around you is strangely detrotsid. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Banishing of Prying Eyes]])
: * Your unnatural urges have been banished. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Banishing of Unnatural Urges]])
: * A &lt;utensil> is floating around you. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Grammer Scorbic's Household Guard]])
: * You are covered with a &lt;size> layer of lard. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Granny Lipintense's Layer of Lard]])
: * You are surrounded by a &lt;size of swarm> of &lt;insects>. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Mama Kolydina's Instant Infestation]])
: * Your ears have been magically muffled. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Wee Flaudia's Fluffy Ear Muffs]])
*[[Wizard]] (or [[magic scroll]])
: * Your skin &lt;various messages>. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Chrenedict's Corporeal Covering]])
: * A &lt;shield> is floating around you. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Endorphin's Floating Friend]])
: * You are surrounded by a [colour] magical impact shield. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator]] or [[Sorklin's Field of Protection]])
: * You are protected by an elemental shield against: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Heezlewurst's Elemental Buffer]], the following lines specify from which elements you are protected and for what approximate duration) 
: * Fire (about an hour)  * Acid (about an hour)  * Cold (about an hour)  * Gas (about an hour).
:  * At the moment, you are also protected against lightning.

==Details of arcane protection==
===Chrenedict's Calcareous Covering===
The approximate number of layers left is shown.  The messages, in order of increasing number of layers, are:
* Your skin has been covered with a thin layer of chalk. (From the outside: "Her skin looks like it has been powdered with chalk.")
* Your skin has been covered with several layers of a chalk-like substance. (From the outside: "Her skin looks as though it has been covered with several layers of a chalk-like substance.")
* Your skin has been hardened with a chalk-like substance. (From the outside: "Her skin looks as though it has been hardened with a chalk-like substance.")
* Your skin is hardened with numerous layers of a mineral-like substance. (From the outside: "Her skin looks strangely mineral-like.")
* Your skin has been hardened to a rock-like form. (From the outside: "Her skin looks as hard as rock.")
(Should be redone with the new [[CCC]] spell for the three new versions){{research}}

===Heezlewurst's Elemental Buffer===
Possible types of energy protected against are acid, gas, cold, fire and/or lightning.  More than one type of damage may be protected against at once.

===Major and minor shield===
The message for [[Major Shield]] or [[Minor Shield]] has two parts, strength and time remaining.

First is the approximate strength.  In (hopefully) order of increasing strength, they are:
* You are protected by the power of &lt;deity>.
* You are really protected by the power of &lt;deity>.
* You are shielded by the protective armour of &lt;deity>.
* You are perfectly protected by the power of &lt;deity>.

Second comes a fuzzy indication of the time remaining.  The messages, in order of increasing amount of time remaining, are:
* You will be protected for less than five minutes.
* You will be protected for at least five minutes.
* You will be protected for at least a quarter of an hour.
* You will be protected for at least half an hour.
* You will be protected for at least an hour.
* You will be protected for at least a couple of hours.
* You will be protected for more than a quarter of a day.
* You will be protected for more than half a day.
* You will be protected for more than a day.
* You will be protected for more than two days.
* You will be protected for more than three days.
* You will be protected for more than four days.
* You will be protected for more than five days.
* ...
* You will be protected for more than fourteen days.
* ??

===Mama Kolydina's Instant Infestation===
The type of [[insects]] present, and the size of the swarm are indicated.  Swarm sizes, in order of increasing size, are:
* A handful 
* A cloud 
* A small swarm 
* A large swarm 
* A vast swarm 
* A plague (this range is much bigger than the others)

===Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator and Sorklin's Field of Protection===
Shield colours, in increasing order of how full the buffer is (how close the shield is to breaking):
* Colourless/invisible - appears as simply, "You are surrounded by a magical impact shield."
* Dull red 
* Bright red 
* Wobbling orange
* Flickering yellow

=== Content from Shout ===
'''Shouting''' is a noisy method of communicating.  If you're in a city, you can shout and everyone within a certain radius who doesn't have shout [[earmuff]]ed will be able to hear you.

In cities, the radius seems to be about fifteen rooms, although this may vary.  In [[terrains]], you cannot hear someone shouting even from the next room, since rooms are supposedly a mile apart.

It's possible that the distance from which you can hear someone shouting varies from player to player, or that some locations (such as the roof of the Drum) are better for hearing shouts.  It seems to be possible to be able to hear someone shouting when they can't hear you.

==Trivia==
*Town criers use shouting to spread their messages.
*If you shout, "Lag!" in [[Ankh-Morpork]], the [[Lag (NPC)|Lag]] will shout back and soul at you.  If you do this in [[Bes Pelargic]], the Laggy-san will shout back and soul at you.
*Shouting "eight" or "8" will disconnect you (and may cause you to have damaged [[stats]] when you log back on). The same happens when shouting "LAG".  This may take more than one shout--or there may be a slight delay.
*A'Tuin shouts a message before [[Offler]] starts the [[reboot]] countdown.
*When someone [[death|dies]] for the last time, there's a message you get if you don't have shout [[earmuff]]ed (although it doesn't look like a shout).

 | items=None
}}

'''Shove''' is a [[:Category:Fighting commands|fighting command]] which can be used to upset an opponent's balance during combat.

==Execution==
Although shove relies on unarmed skills, it may be performed whether holding a weapon or not.  In order to successfully shove an opponent, one must:
*Pass a [[fighting.special.unarmed]] test in order to prepare the attack.
*Succeed in a skillcheck of [[fighting.unarmed.grappling]] and [[strength]] against the opponent's appropriate [[fighting.defence]] skill (depending on their tactics response setting), [[strength]] and [[dexterity]].

==Effects==
The effects depend on the degree of success of the skillcheck:
*A high degree of success results in the victim being sent crashing to the ground, costing them a lot of [[action points]].  They remain at a substantial AP disadvantage until they get up again (which occurs automatically).  During this period, they cannot be [[trip]]ped or shoved again.
*A lesser degree of success causes the victim to stumble, costing them a few [[action points]].
*Failure causes the ''attacker'' to stumble, costing ''them'' a few [[action points]].

==Notes==
You cannot start a combat with shove. If you attempt to shove a target you are not fighting then you will simply use the emote on them. If you attempt &lt;code>nosoul shove [target]&lt;/code> you get the message &lt;code>You are not fighting the [target]&lt;/code>. This makes TM'ing the skills from low level difficult as you usually kill low-level targets before you can get a shove in.

shove                        Discworld command help                        shove


Name
     shove - Push someone to the ground.                                   

Syntax
     shove &lt;living>                                                        

Description
     This command allows you to push your opponent to the ground.  This    
     does not directly injure them but does leave them vulnerable since    
     they must regain their feet and return to a fighting position.        
                                                                           
     The effects of shoving are subtle and may not be immediately obvious  
     but that does not mean they are not present.                          
                                                                           
     Your ability in fighting.special.unarmed determines your ability to   
     prepare this tactic, and your unarmed grappling skill combined with   
     your strength determines the efficacy of your manoeuvre.              
                                                                           
     The opponent's defence skill and their strength and dexterity         
     determine their ability to defend against your attack.                
                                                                           
     It will cost you 30 fighting guild points to attempt to shove         
     somebody.                                                             

Example
     > shove warrior                                                            
     You prepare to shove the warrior.

== Skill System ==

=== Trees and branches ===
Discworld uses a skill system, which is divided into eight skilltrees:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|[[Adventuring (skill tree)]]
|-
|[[Covert (skill tree)]]
|-
|[[Crafts (skill tree)]]
|-
|[[Faith (skill tree)]]
|-
|[[Fighting (skill tree)]]
|-
|[[Magic (skill tree)]]
|-
|[[People (skill tree)]]
|-
|[[Languages]]
|}

A tree can branch into subskills and sub-subskills.

What you actually use is the '''bonus''', not the level. But to increase your bonus you need to increase your level or change your [[stats]], which can be done temporarily with [[stat effects]].

To refer to a skill you have to provide the path to it, for example &lt;code>fighting.defence.dodging&lt;/code>.
*You can abbreviate skills by only listing a few letters: &lt;code>skills fi.de.do&lt;/code>.
*Note that if two skills could be referred by such reduced version the mud will use one, but this might not be the one you want. For example, &lt;code>ma.me.me.ch&lt;/code> is channeling, not charming, so you'd have to use &lt;code>skills ma.me.me.char&lt;/code> instead.

Languages are special, you start with one and need to learn others from specific teachers before you can improve them. They do not use stats.

=== Calculation of levels ===
The level of the skilltree is calculated by taking the average of the levels of the main branches and rounding this down to the nearest integer. On its turn, the level of a (sub) branch is calculated the same way, by taking the average of the levels of the sub (sub) branches and rounding this down to the nearest integer.

=== Calculation of guild level ===
A player's guild level is not the skilltree level of his specialisation (shown by 'skills primaries').
The guild level is calculated by taking the average of the level of the outermost branches and round this down to the nearest integer. For a wizard, the outermost branches are e.g. magic.methods.mental.animating and magic.methods.mental.channeling, not magic.methods.mental nor magic.methods.

==Improving your skills==
There are 4 methods of improving your level, and hence your bonus, in a skill.

===The Taskmaster===
To gain levels from the taskmaster you don't need to do anything, just using skills has a chance to advance your skills!
*The [[taskmaster]] is the system that performs skill checks on Discworld.  It decides if you pass or fail a skill check, the degree to which you do so, and whether you are to be awarded a skill increase as part of your attempts.
*To '''TM''' is to gain a level from the taskmaster.
*It is often said that you have the most chance to get a TM when you have 50% chance to pass a skillcheck.

Cost: Skill increases awarded by taskmasker are "free" advancement, they have no [[XP]] or financial cost.

===Advance: Instruction by Guild===
Every [[guilds|guild]] has a [[guild teachers|teacher]] who will advance you to some level in all skills; however, the level to which they are willing to teach you in various skills will depend upon your choice of guild and, in some cases, your specialisation within the guild.
*This is done with the &lt;code>advance&lt;/code> command (in the presence of a [[guild teacher]]).
*Use the &lt;code>cost&lt;/code> command (in the presence of a [[guild teacher]]) to see how much one or several skill advance will cost.
*For example: &lt;code>cost primaries&lt;/code>, &lt;code>cost magic&lt;/code>, &lt;code>cost ma.points&lt;/code>, etc.
*Guilds will advance [[primaries]] up to level 300; all other skills are taught to a lower level.
*For example, Priests may advance all [[faith (skill tree)|faith skills]] up to level 300 within the guild, but may only advance [[magic (skill tree)|magic skills]] up to level 5.
*Examples: &lt;code>advance magic&lt;/code>, &lt;code>advance ma.sp&lt;/code>, &lt;code>advance ma.sp.offensive&lt;/code>
*To advance a skill tree, find the advancement room/person and type advance [skill]. So to advance your skill tree for magic type "advance magic" without the quotation marks. 
*To advance a branch of a skill, simply type advance [skill.branch] 

Cost: Advancing within your guild is the second cheapest in terms of XP cost after taskmaster skill increases, and costs AM$ 12.50 or equivalent per 100k [[XP]] spent on skills.

===Teachers===
All players are able to [[teach]] their skill to other players, subject to their bonus in the relevant skills being high enough.
*Learning from another player is considerably more expensive than advancing from a guild, but always cheaper (sometimes not by much) than learning from yourself (see below).

Cost: Learning from a teacher has a high [[XP]] cost, but generally has no financial cost. The teacher receives a portion of the XP you spend in return for teaching you.

===Self Teaching===
Self teaching is the application of your [[XP]] to teaching yourself skills.  

Cost: This is the most expensive method, but it has the benefit of always being available, and can also be done no matter what level you currently have in the skill.

==Skills tree table==

 | skills=[[Fighting.special.weapon]] and [[Fighting.melee]] for the weapon used
 | items=A [[weapon]] [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Slash|that allows slash]]
}}


'''Slash''' is a [[:Category:Fighting commands|fighting command]] that is used mid combat and can be used to do a lot of damage to an enemy. Whether a weapon is capable of launching this [[special attack]] can be found through use of the [[judge]] command.
Most [[swords]] and [[daggers]] allow slashing. In addition, some [[heavy-swords]], [[flails]], [[misc weapons]], and a couple of [[polearms]] also allow slashing.

[[Special:WhatLinksHere/Slash | Pages that link to this page]]: mostly weapons that this command can be used with.

==Acquisition==
Slash can be learned at 15 levels of [[fighting.special.weapon]] from a warrior guild instructor or from another player who has the command.

== Syntax ==
 slash &lt;living> with &lt;weapon>
 slash &lt;living> [in|at] [the] &lt;zone> with &lt;weapon>
 slash compare &lt;zone 1> with &lt;zone 2>
 slash &lt;living> [in|at] [a] random [zone] with &lt;weapon>

== Target zones ==
Damage and difficulty will depend on the zone targeted. From weakest to most damaging the target zones are:
 legs
 arms
 stomach
 face
 neck
 
The more damage the zone does, the more difficult it is to prepare the attack.

=== Content from Social_points ===

==Using social points==
Social points are consumed by certain commands:
*a [[tell]]: 1 point
*an untargetted [[soul]]: 3 points
*a [[remote]]: 5 points
*a targetted soul (including self-targetted): 6 points
*an [[emote]]: at least 1 point, but the exact number varies based on the emote.  Longer emotes cost more.  For letters only, the cost seems to be one point plus one for every ten characters.  If numbers are involved, it seems to cost slightly more.
*[[shout]]ing: at least 10 points, but the exact number varies based on the message.  Longer messages cost more points.  For letters only, the cost seems to be 10 points plus ten for every five characters.  If numbers are involved, it seems to cost slightly more.
*the [[position]] command: 100 points
*Using the [[godmother]]'s service costs all your social points if you are in a certain [[guild level]] range.

Although these points will regenerate with time, at a rate of one per [[heartbeat]], a player may be unable to communicate fully when their social points have run down. This may serve to reduce player generated spam.

==Reducing your maximum social points==
There are also things that temporarily reduce your ''maximum'' number of social points.
*If you kill a [[pet]], including your own or one that has been consigned, your maximum social points are reduced to 1.
*Shouting reduces your maximum social points by at least one.  The longer the message, the more they are reduced.

When your maximum social points have been reduced in this fashion, there are two things you can do.  First, you can wait.  They will eventually go back to normal, although the rate of increase is much slower than the regeneration rate, taking a few minutes to increase by one.  Secondly, you can use tells, emotes, souls, remotes, or position.  Any of these will increase your maximum by one, even as they consume points.

=== Content from Soul ===

==Usage and syntax==
Each soul has a help file demonstrating syntax, defaults, and arguments (if "#" is listed as a possible argument, this means you can put in anything you want there). If a soul has multiple choices for arguments, you may use "?" to get a random argument (i.e. "beam ?" or "beam ? pinkfish").

You can also use "syntax &lt;soul>" to see the syntax.

===Targetting===
Most souls are targettable--they can be directed at other people.  If a player is not [[earmuff]]ing remote-soul and isn't in [[roleplaying (command)|roleplaying mode]], you can direct targettable souls at them even if they're not in the same room.  [[NPC]]s, on the other hand, must be in the same room for you to target them with souls.

You can target multiple people at once with a soul by putting multiple names in, separated by commas and no spaces, like so:

&lt;pre>hug womble,frog&lt;/pre>

Earmuffing multiple-soul will stop people from being able to include you in these.

===Confusion with other commands===
There are some commands that share a name with a soul command.  These include:
*[[gaze]]
*[[kick]]
*[[pick]]
*[[black top hat|pull]]
*[[punch]]
*[[Music|serenade]]
*[[shove]]
*[[squint]]
*[[stab]]
*[[tempt]]
*[[throw]]
*[[trip]]

To make sure you're using the soul version of it, you can preface it with "soul".  Alternatively, to make sure you're ''not'' using the soul, you can preface it with "nosoul".

However, the MUD will generally pick the most appropriate version on its own. If you find yourself unexpectedly using the soul version, it may be because you ''can't'' use the other version--for example, you may not have enough gp, you may not be in combat with the target yet (as there is a slight delay between entering "kill" and actually being in combat with them), you may be directing the command at an invalid target (such as trying to serenade yourself on an instrument), or you may be using the wrong syntax.

==Effect==
Souls don't generally have a tangible effect on the target, although some npcs will react to some of them.  For example, [[Kess of Sek]]'s response to many souls is to attack the souler, and certain souls, when directed at [[Ankh-Morpork]] watchmen, can be criminal offenses (molesting or insulting an officer of the watch).

The "push" and "throw" souls also have the potential to change someone's [[position]].

Using a soul also uses up a small number of [[social points]].

===Visibility===
Aside from being visible to the souler and the target, souls are also visible to anyone in the same room with anyone souling or being souled at.
It is possible to use [[Pinkfish colour codes]] in your souls, but recipients will only register colour if they have the "output usercolour" option enabled.
You can set a [[colour]] for (other people's) souls.

=== Content from Special_Abilities ===
Special abilities were added to the game on 12 April 2015, as described in this {{Devblog|584|blog post}}.
They boost your abilities in one area of combat, at the expense of another area.

To learn an ability you need to meditate by a statue of a hero.
There is usually some requirement to be able to learn the ability.

To forget an ability, you need to meditate by the same statue again. The requirement to learn the ability must be met in order to forget the ability.

===Locations===
====Ankh-Morpork====
The statue can be found southeast of the junction of Short Street, Heroes Street and God Street.
&lt;pre>Sampson Ronius

(also known as)

 The Bodyguard&lt;/pre>

Sampson requires sufficient health (hp) and the sacrifice of a shield (large metal worked, small and medium did not).
The ability is to deflect damage and spend less energy when defending someone else.
Only warriors can learn this ability.

====Ephebe====
The statue can be found on the southeastern end of Hypothetical Road, at the junction.
&lt;pre>Yo-lo

(also known as)

Beyond Insane&lt;/pre>

"You can feel the voice of Yo-lo whispering secrets into your mind.  Knowing these lessons, you will henceforth completely ignore defence to attack all out."

Seems to let you use all AP (or not need any AP?) for melee, practically guaranteeing you can get your melee hits in against many opponents... however you will not even try to use any melee defence.  You will not dodge, parry, or block.  You will not somehow avoid.  Every incoming hit will hit you/your shields/your armour.  Fresh shields, and/or very heavy armour is recommended.

Being shoved/tripped etc. still seems to prevent you attacking until you recover.

[[Endorphin's Floating Friend]] will still block incoming hits as normal, and drain AP as normal, but the instant EFF drops, everything will hit you at once (just like when you have no AP when your EFF drops).

Anyone can learn this ability, but it requires a minimum health value of around 3000 (2808 HP wasn't enough, 3000+ was).  You can bypass this if you get enough stat boosts to push your HP up (it only cares about your current HP itself, not your levels in ad.health).

====Sto Lat====
The statue can be found in the Sto Lat cemetery at the western edge.
&lt;pre>Cas'leb the Merciless

   (also known as)

  The Dirty Fighter&lt;/pre>

Requires 250 levels of fighting.unarmed.striking. 
The ability is to use knee attacks when fighting unarmed.

====Genua====
The statue can be found at the junction of Genua Avenue and Dauphin Street. 
&lt;pre>Callus Tacticus

(also known as)

  The Focuser&lt;/pre>

A sword needs to be sacrificed to the statue before you can acquire any skills. If the sword is regarded as too cheap the sacrifice will be rejected (e.g. a duan jian worth {{Gmoney|6,3,33Gf}} is too cheap, a colichemarde (from Rene's shop on Okra Avenue) worth {{Gmoney|6,6,66Gf}} is accepted). The ability is to be more effective when trying to hit a specific part of your opponent.&lt;br>

Requires 150 levels of perception skill (ad.pe) and a minimum in a weapon(currently unknown) or 200 levels of unarmed.striking skill (fi.un.st)

Syntax: &lt;meditate by callus>

You will get this message below if you are not high enough level by meditating.

"You require a greater proficiency with a weapon or unarmed combat! shows when meditating at too low a level."

If you do have enough levels it will tell you this message.

"You feel a heavy weight on your mind, reminding you that Callus requires a sacrifice of a sword before teaching you how best to be a focuser."

You will need to use the the syntax below first and then meditate after.

Syntax: &lt;sacrifice sword to callus>

Replace sword if you need to specify which sword you want to sacrifice.

====Djelibeybi====
The statue can be found in the front room of the Harbourmaster's office.
&lt;pre>Herness Emngwey

(also known as)

The Pacifist&lt;/pre>

Requires a minimum guild level of 200.
The ability is to defend yourself better at the expense of not attacking, i.e. it disables baseround attacks and gives you some unknown defense boost. You can still use 'special' attacks, such as stab, pierce, impale etc.

After testing, the "defense boost" seems to be letting you use all your AP for defending and no actual damage reduction or added bonus.

==Help file==
&lt;pre>
special abilities              Discworld player help              special abilities

* Name *

Special abilities - combat bonuses in your chosen speciality

* Description *

To encourage diversity in playing styles, there are a number of "special abilities". These are talents which make you better at certain areas of combat. All special abilities are passive and do not require the use of commands. There are many aspects of combat which have an associated special ability, for instance: defending other players, fighting unarmed or using particular tactics settings.

The catch, however, is that you can only have one special ability. Once chosen, you can easily swap your ability for another.

Your current special ability is shown in your (verbose) score.

* Learning special abilities *

At various places on Discworld, statues of ancient heroes have been placed, along with a plaque describing what special ability they were renowned for.

To learn a special ability, you can meditate at the corresponding statue. By meditating at the same statue again, you will forget the ability. Alternatively, if you have a special ability and meditate at a different statue, you will forget the first and learn the new one in its place.

Not all abilities can be learned by everyone: some abilities are limited to certain guilds, or require specific skills, quests or achievements before they can be learned. 
&lt;/pre>

=== Content from Special_interfaces ===

However, if while using one of these you want to perform a command outside of the interface, you can do so by starting the line with an exclamation mark ("&lt;tt>!&lt;/tt>").  This can be handy for making bug reports about dangerous rooms or things (since you can start the report, then leave the room), responding to tells while in the middle of something, or escaping an ordering interface when you're not sure how to do so properly.

==Editors==
The editor--whichever one you've chosen--is used for the following:
*[[mail|MUDmail]]
*posting on the [[bulletin board]]s from within the MUD
*making [[bug report|bug, typo, and idea reports]]
*[[writing]] on things
*editing [[aliases]] with the "&lt;tt>ealias&lt;/tt>" command

The "&lt;tt>editor&lt;/tt>" command lets you choose which editor to use.

===Menu editor===
This editor is the default.

When you first enter it, everything you type--except for lines consisting of two asterisks ("&lt;tt>**&lt;/tt>") and lines beginning with exclamation marks--is added to the message you're writing.  You can use enter/return to start a new line.  Typing ** will take you out of this part of the interface, and bring up some options:
*'''H''' - brings up a helpfile explaining the options
*'''I''' - insert text, before a line you will be asked to specify
*'''D''' - delete a line or range of lines which you will be asked to specify
*'''L''' - list, or show everything that you've written so far
*'''M''' - modify a line or range of lines which you will be asked to specify.  You'll then be asked what text you want to change and what to change it to, and it will modify every occurrence of that text in the specified lines, then show you the result.
*'''C''' - continue editing; add more text starting at the end
*'''E''' - enter the ed editor
*'''S''' - save your changes and post, send, finish writing, whatever
*'''Q''' - quit without saving any changes or posting, sending, etc., anything

If you're in this part of the interface and enter anything it doesn't understand (including a blank line), it will just give you the menu again.  So if you accidentally type "d", for example, and don't want to delete anything after all, you can just hit enter or return and nothing will be deleted.  Prefacing a command with an exclamation mark to do things outside of the interface works here, too, not just when you're writing the message.

Commands are case insensitive.

===Magic editor===
The magic editor has far more commands available than the default editor, and help for them that can be accessed while you're using it.  It allows finer control and lets you [[rot13]] lines directly.

===Ed===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_%28text_editor%29 Ed].

===Command editor===
This one is similar to the menu editor and has the same commands, but entering &lt;tt>**&lt;/tt> will cause you to save and quit instead of bringing up a menu, and you enter commands by prefacing them with ~.

===Web editor===
With this option, you're given a link to a web page with a text input form.  You can then type what you want into that form, and it will be saved when you click the "save" button on that page.  However, entering any commands into the MUD before saving will cancel the editor.

Using it looks like this:
{{Prebox|>write on paper with pen
&lt;br>You start writing on the small piece of cigarette paper with the silver fountain pen.
&lt;br>Point your browser at:
https://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/secure/pedit.c
&lt;br>You finish writing on the small piece of cigarette paper.}}

If you're using it to edit pre-existing text (for example, using it to edit an existing alias), then that text will already be in the form.

==Converse==
The "&lt;tt>converse&lt;/tt>" command causes everything you type to be said (or, if you've specified a person to converse with, sent to them in tells).  Sending a line consisting of two asterisks will stop it, and, as with says, you can start a line with #&lt;language name> to say something in a particular [[language]].  For example:
&lt;pre>converse
Give '**' to stop.
] 
#morporkian Hello.
You say: Hello.
] 
#uberwaldean Hello.
You say in Uberwaldean: Hello.
] 
#klatchian Hello.
You say in Klatchian: Hello.
] 
#agatean Hello.
You say in Agatean: Hello.
] 
Hello
You say in Djelian: Hello
] 
**
Ok.&lt;/pre>

==Repeat==
The "&lt;tt>repeat&lt;/tt>" command is similar in concept to "&lt;tt>converse&lt;/tt>", but it can be used with any command, not just say and tell.  Essentially, you specify a command, and until you exit the interface, everything you enter will be prefaced by that command.

For example, you can use it to drag an item for multiple rooms without needing to type "drag" over and over.

&lt;pre>repeat drag sack
Enter the commands you wish to pass to drag sack.  "**" on a line by itself to exit.
] 
e
Doing "drag sack e"
You get hold of the hessian sack.
You drag the hessian sack behind you.
A deciduous forest close to a gorge [n,e,jump s,w].
A Lancre reciprocating fox is standing here.
A hessian sack is on the ground.
You let go of the hessian sack.
] 
**
&lt;/pre>

==Ordering custom items==
Most [[:Category:Customization|custom peddlers]], it should be noted, respond to says and don't use a special interface.  Some, though, such as [[Mrs. Cosmopilite]] and [[Ug Ogg]], use an interface where you type your choice instead of saying it out loud, so any command you enter without prefacing it with an exclamation mark will be interpreted as trying to make a choice.  You can type "quit" (for Mrs. Cosmopilite) or "end" (for Ug Ogg) to stop ordering.

==Rituals and spells==
Some rituals and spells require--or sometimes require--additional input after being performed or cast, and will interpret the next thing you enter as said input.  These include:
*[[Find Corpse]], which requires the name of the player whose [[corpse]] it is
*[[Independent Recurring Vocaliser]], which requires the message to be repeated by the item
*[[Raise Dead Pet]] which may require the name of the pet to be returned from the dead

==Reading help files==
When reading a help file that's longer than your specified number of rows, you'll be "stuck" in it until you either reach the end (by repeatedly hitting enter or return) or type "&lt;tt>q&lt;/tt>" or "&lt;tt>quit&lt;/tt>".

You can also type "&lt;tt>g&lt;/tt>" to go to the beginning, "&lt;tt>f&lt;/tt>" to go forward, and "&lt;tt>b&lt;/tt>" to go back.

=== Content from Spells ===

Spells are divided into three types:
*'''Offensive''' spells which are designed to be cast on enemies but which might have other uses.
*'''Defensive''' spells which protect the target in some way.
*'''Miscellaneous''' spells which don't fall into the two previous category and do a variety of different things.

The tables below show the name which must be used for that spell, the [[guild points]] cost for casting the spell, the [[head space]] needed to hold the spell into memory, which is 5 times the [[thaums]] produced by casting the spell, the Size/GP ratio which indicates how efficiently the spell produces thaums and finally the type previously described.

=== Content from Splint ===
 | gp = 50 crafts, 30 magic
 | learntat = level 30 in [[crafts.medicine.treatment.injury|injury]]
 | skills = [[crafts.medicine.treatment.injury]], [[magic.methods.mental.charming]]
 | items = 2 willow withes, 4 strips of cloth
 | guild = [[Witches' Guild]]
}}

[[Witches]] know that to help people you need to use skin, not just magic.

Following an unfortunate incident involving Greebo, someone from ''Forn Places'' and a breaking of legs, Nanny Ogg {{Devblog|393 announced}} she would start teaching witches how to make a splint on those unfortunate enough to break their legs (including yourself, what with flight &lt;s>drinking&lt;/s> accidents). That way she won't be bothered every time Greebo "affectionately" steps on someone, or whenever [[broken legs|acts of leg breaking]] occur.

==Acquisition==
Only witches can learn the splint command. Nanny teaches it to those who have enough knowledge of injuries i.e. 30 levels of [[crafts.medicine.treatment.injury]]. You may also learn from other players.

Make sure that you get the command before trying to splint a leg as it won't just pop up on its own when your leg is broken.

&lt;pre>
You say: teach me please

Nanny Ogg nods.
Nanny Ogg says with a Lancrastian accent: 'Bout time you learned a new trick, luv.
Nanny Ogg whispers to you with a Lancrastian accent: Here's a handy thing to be able to do if you tend to fly while Under the Influence.  I oughter know.
Nanny Ogg winks at at you.
Nanny Ogg mutters something about legs under her breath.
Nanny Ogg whispers to you with a Lancrastian accent: You'll be needing some supplies to use it, of course.  Smart gel like you will know where to find 'em.
Nanny Ogg nods knowingly at you.
Nanny Ogg loudly exclaims with a Lancrastian accent: Run along now an' give it a try!
&lt;/pre>

==Components==
In order to make a splint you need 2 willow withes and 4 strips of cloths (bandages). Also at least one [[broken leg]].

Failed attempts to make a splint does not consume the components but once it is successfully made the items are discarded and not returned when the leg has finished healing.

You can get '''willow withes''' from the tree by the creek near Granny's place. To get a withe, hold a sharp object and use "cut withe from &lt;tree> with &lt;object>".

'''Strips of cloth''' that can be used to [[bandage]] are also required, which can be produced with the command '''tear''' on clothing or other items made of cloth.
*Only strips made from certain types of cloth are suitable for use as bandages.
**The description of an appropriate strip of cloth will contain the line: "It is strong enough to bind even the nastiest flesh wounds."
**The materials suitable for bandages mentioned in "help tear" are: '''cotton''', batiste, denim, organdy, terry cloth, broadcloth, dotted quirm, pique, twill, batik, corduroy, lawn, seersucker, voile, '''linen''', hessian, canvas, '''silk''' and hemp. 
**Clothes made from wool '''cannot''' be used as bandages.
**Suitable strips can be referred to as '''bandages''', e.g. "put bandages in medicine bag".
**The exact material(s) an item is made of can be seen with the command [[appraise]].
*The size and condition of an item determines how many strips can be produced by tearing it - this is not skill-checked.
**The "tear test" command shows how many strips will be created without actually tearing the item.
**The size of an item determines the maximum number of strips that item can yield. This size is directly related to the size of the body parts that the items covers, see the [[coverage]] command.
**If the [[condition]] of the item is below perfect then the number of strips obtained is reduced. Note that even items in excellent condition might be a little bit damaged and possible to [[sew]] them.
*Be careful not to tear something you want to keep as you cannot get the item back after it's in pieces!

If you keep the strips of cloth and the withes in a container [[identify|identified]] as "component pouch" or "medicine bag" then they are automatically used as if they were in your inventory when you splint. They are not even taken out so if you fail they won't clutter your carried inventory.

==Usage==
Once you learned the command, got the components and someone broke a leg, you can try out your splinting skills!
*splint &lt;side> leg for &lt;name>
*splint my &lt;side> leg
See below for help from Nanny getting a broken leg.

If both legs are broken you need to splint twice, and so on, one new splint per broken leg.

If you're trying to splint your own broken leg you'll have to do it under the -3 [[dexterity]] stat penalty or -6 dexterity for both legs. This does not affect [[magic.methods.mental.charming|charming]] but [[crafts.medicine.treatment.injury|injury]] will drop a little bit since it has 1/5 dexterity.

====Failure (skills)====
&lt;pre>You attempt to splint your broken leg, but fail to tie the knots tight enough and it falls apart.&lt;/pre>
Others see:
&lt;pre>&lt;Witch> attempts to splint her broken leg, but fails to tie the knots tight enough and it falls apart.&lt;/pre>

====Failure (greaves)====
Wearing armour over the broken leg like [[leather greaves]] can block a splint attempt. This is probably because the greaves cannot be worn at the same time as a splint as they both occupy the same armour slot. Any other items in the same slot would logically also block splint.

&lt;pre>
You cannot apply a splint to Someone's broken leg whilst they are wearing something over the wound.

You cannot apply a splint to your broken leg whilst wearing a pair of leather greaves.

You cannot put on the pair of leather greaves since you are already wearing a splint.
&lt;/pre>

Other armours like miniskirts, skirts, robes, cloaks and leggings do not need to be removed to be able to splint.

====Success (witch splints herself)====
&lt;pre>You strap up your right leg with some bandages and willow withes, then gently nudge the splint to remind it that it has a job to do and that perhaps it should work a little harder.&lt;/pre>
Others see:
&lt;pre>&lt;Witch> straps up her broken leg whilst poking at the splint.&lt;/pre>

====Partial success====
Failing the magic part makes a mundane splint. It is unclear how long such a splint would take to heal the leg or if it just helps walking around.
&lt;pre>You strap up your left leg with some bandages and willow withes, and mumble what you think are some good magic words to charm the splint to work faster.  However, the splint doesn't share your compassion for speedy recoveries and just continues to be a normal splint.&lt;/pre>

====Success (witch splints somebody else)====
&lt;pre>You strap up &lt;target>'s right leg with some bandages and willow withes whilst running your hands across the splint and gently whispering about what might happen if it doesn't start working harder.&lt;/pre>
Patient sees:
&lt;pre>&lt;Witch> straps up your broken leg with some bandages and willow withes whilst running her
hands over the splint and whispering to it.&lt;/pre>

Alternate:
&lt;pre>You strap up &lt;target's> right leg with some bandages and willow withes, then fix the splint with a piercing stare that could turn any inanimate object into a very obedient (if not slightly scared) healing tool.&lt;/pre>
Patient sees:
&lt;pre>&lt;Witch> straps up your broken leg with some bandages and willow withes whilst glaring at it sternly.&lt;/pre>

====Worn splints====
Once the command succeeds, the splint(s) is an object that the target is wearing.
 Made from sturdy willow withes and bandages, these splints have been secured around your left and right legs.
Removing this object before the legs are healed will discard the splint(s) and the healing will not happen.

====Mending====
Now the leg will take some time to mend. Meanwhile you can hobble around without taking too much damage:
&lt;pre>Your splint helps to support your broken leg as you move but you experience some discomfort.
Hp: 2253 (2258) Gp: 419 (419) Xp: 31805&lt;/pre>

The time it takes to mend depends on how charming you were towards the splint.
*With a 342 [[magic.methods.mental.charming]] bonus it took 8 minutes 2 seconds.
*With a 384 [[magic.methods.mental.charming]] bonus it took 6 minutes 36 seconds.
*If the relation between duration and bonus is linear, then it should take just under 5 minutes at a 431 bonus and be instantaneous at a 578 bonus unless there is a minimum time limit.
&lt;pre>The break in your right leg seem to have mended nicely, so you remove the splint from it.
You discard the used bandages and withes.&lt;/pre>

If you are impatient you can also go with your splinted leg see a [[doctor]] to get it set.

No more broken leg!

==Testing==
Nanny is extremely happy to help testing the command, just ask her politely and she'll [[Broken leg|break your leg]]. She'll only do it after you learned splint of course, wouldn't you look silly with a broken leg and unable to make a splint? It's probably not a good idea to do this immediately on learning the skill, unless you have more levels in [[crafts.medicine.treatment.injury]] than the minimum.

&lt;pre>
Nanny Ogg asks with a Lancrastian accent: Wot, like this?
Nanny Ogg trips you.
Nanny Ogg jumps up and down on you.
Nanny Ogg looks smug.
&lt;/pre>

If you can splint your own leg you'll know you can help others since it'll be a little bit easier to do without stat penalties.

You may also practice and TM on the [[Doctor#Medical_mannequin|Medical Mannequin]] for a small fee.

 | items=A piercing [[weapon]] [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Stab |that allows stab]]
}}


'''Stab''' is a [[:Category:Fighting commands|fighting command]] that is used mid combat and can be used to do a lot of damage to an enemy. Whether a weapon is capable of launching this [[special attack]] can be found through use of the [[judge]] command.
Most [[daggers]] and [[swords]] allow stabbing. In addition, some [[polearms]] and [[misc weapons]], a few [[axes]], and a couple of [[heavy-swords]] also allow stabbing.

[[Special:WhatLinksHere/Stab | Pages that link to this page]]: mostly weapons that this command can be used with.

__TOC__
{{-}}
==Acquisition==
Stab can be learned at 15 levels of [[fighting.special.weapon]] from another player who has the command, or from an instructor at your guild if it teaches the command.

== Syntax ==
 stab &lt;target> with &lt;weapon>
 stab &lt;target> [in|at] [the] {legs|back|neck|arms|face|feet|heart} with &lt;weapon>
 stab &lt;target> [in|at] [a] random [zone] with &lt;weapon>
 stab compare &lt;zone 1> with &lt;zone 2>

== Target zones ==
Damage and difficulty will depend on the zone targeted. From weakest to most damaging the target zones are:
 legs|arms
 feet
 back
 neck
 heart|face

The more damage the zone does, the more difficult it is to prepare the attack.

=== Content from Stat_effects ===

Some effects conflict with each other and with '''stat items''', which are items that provide at least partly positive stat effects.

The effects of being subjected to conflicted effects/items is explained in the [[#Combining_stat_items|Combining_stat_items]] section.

Other stat effects do not interact with stat items or other stat effects, they come under [[#Positive_stat_effects_.28or_partly_positive.29_that_do_not_conflict_with_other_effects|positive and partly positive]] and [[#Negative_stat_effects|negative]].

{{TOC right}}

==Interactions==

Any reduction of [[strength]] that causes you to become burdened 50% or more will additionally give a [[dexterity]] penalty due to the burden.

Many stat items and effects affect more than one stat. 

==Combining stat items==
This has {{devblog|1018|changed on Tue Jul 2 11:30:32 2024}}

&lt;pre>
The effects of stacking stat items are no longer dependent on the order in which you equip the items. For positive stat effects, the final effect should now be the best boost that was possible with the old calculation. Moreover, the bless ritual will no longer interfere with equipped stat items.

Note that for some combinations of items, the negative stat effects are now slightly harsher than before; for example, wearing a flat cap and bronze helm now gives you -4 con instead of -3 con. This was an unavoidable side-effect of the new calculation, but we hope that it is an acceptable price to pay for the consistency and bless-proof-ness of the new system.

If there is a combination you rely on that is now overall substantially worse for you when both positive and negative effects are taken into consideration, please make a bugrep on one of the relevant items, stating all of the following information: what items make up the combo, what it used to give you, what it gives you now, and why this is a problem (in as much detail as possible).
&lt;/pre>

==Equipable [[:Category:Stat items|Stat Items]]==

===[[Bronze helm]] (+3 Int, +2 Wis, -3 Con)===

+3 [[intelligence]], +2 [[wisdom]], -3 [[constitution]]

Does HP damage and eventually kills if worn for too long.

===[[Black leather gloves|Dex Gloves]] (+2 Dex, -1 Str)===

+2 [[dexterity]], -1 [[strength]], Drains GP

===[[Flat cap]] (+3 Wis, +2 Int, -3 Str)===

+3 [[wisdom]], +2 [[intelligence]], -3 [[strength]]

Does HP damage, and eventually kills if worn for too long.

===[[Klein bottle]] (+1 Int or +2 Int)===
A Klein bottle gives +1 of [[intelligence]] while the bottle is held and filled with "small waves", "eddying currents", "turbulence", "whirlpool" or "maelstrom" of energy.

A Klein bottle gives +2 of [[intelligence]] while the bottle is held and filled with "tempest", "vortex" or "impossible chaos" of energy.

===[[Prayer beads]] (+1 Wis or +2 Wis)===

+1 [[wisdom]] at bright, +2 [[wisdom]] at radiant

These must be held and charged by using faith gp before they become stat items.

Wizards and Witches are unable to hold prayer beads, so are unable to gain any stat benefit from prayer beads, even when fully charged.

===[[Iron gauntlets|Strength Gauntlets]] (+2 Str)===

+2 [[strength]],  drains GP

===[[Thief's dagger]]s (+1 Dex)===

+1 [[dexterity]]

Two of them must be held at once.

==Positive effects that interfere with stat items and each other==

===[[Bless]] (+1 All)===

Gained from the ritual.
*The effect of Bless is suppressed during the use of any [[stat items]].
*This means that while any stat item is active (worn, held) Bless has no effect.
*Bless is not canceled, if you remove/unhold all stat items while Bless is still active then the effect returns.

Ways to get bless without a player performing it:
* By offering tobacco or makeup at the shrine to [[Oshun]] at the northwest end of Lover's Walk in [[Genua]].
* Inside a hidden shrine to the Small Gods in [[Djelibeybi]] if your alignment is good enough, but it takes a while to reset after an attempted use.
* You can try searching a [[cairn]] in [[Djelibeybi]], but you might get a lightning bolt to the head instead.
* It is one of the rewards for giving a sacrifice at one of the [[sacrificial altar]]s in [[Ephebe]], but wizards and witches cannot receive rewards for it.
* There's a shrine in the courtyard of the [[Chronides farmhouse]] where you can offer [[incense]] for a bless.

===[[Squint#Blink|Blink]] (+1 Str)===
Witches can squint with method blinking thereby inspiring humans to have +1 [[strength]] for a while.
*There is no confirmed blink that increased [[strength]] by +2, though this might be possible with godly bonuses.
*Blink used to interfere with stat items and other effects in this section, but it should be tested again. {{research}}

==Positive stat effects (or partly positive) that do not conflict with other effects==

===[[Berserk]] (+1 Str and Dex)===

Gained from the command. After berserk wears off, there will be -2 to [[strength]] and [[constitution]] for a while.
*Can only be used by warriors.

===Chocolate die (+1 or +2 random stat, -1 after)===
Sold at the Mad Wolf sweetie shop. 
*Usually gives +1 to a random stat for a while, and then -1 to that stat for a while afterwards.
*Other times it gives -1 to a stat for a while, and then +1 to that stat for a while afterwards.
*It's also possible to receive +2 to a random stat instead, and -1 for a while afterwards.
*The chance of that may depend on being a {{Achievement|sweet tooth|valued customer}} at the shop.
*Consuming an additional die while still under the effects of a first gives -1 [[constitution]]. You have to wait for a message that says "you feel normal again" before eating a new die without penalty.
*This stat effect appears to stack with other stat effects.

===Edible cockroaches (+1 int, -5 con, -2 dex)===
Eating edible cockroaches can give you +1 [[intelligence]] for about 5 minutes, but also -5 [[constitution]] and -2 [[dexterity]].

===Ephebian horse (+2 int)===
A replica of the wooden horse used in the Tsortean wars is located in the northeast outside the citadel in [[Ephebe]].
*Being inside for around 15 seconds gives +2 [[intelligence]] for about 15 minutes, followed by +1 [[intelligence]] for the next 15 minutes.
*This bonus can be used without interfere with other stat effects.

===[[Intelligence tea]]  (+1 int, then -1 int)===
Gives +1 [[intelligence]] when drunk, and then -1 intelligence for a while. This effect can be combined with other effects that do not affect [[intelligence]].

===Sek altar (+1 str)===
Putting a [[human heart]] on the [[Sek]] low altar in [[Ankh-Morpork]] gives you +1 [[strength]] for 15 minutes.
*This can be combined with other effects without experiencing additional negative modifiers.

===Shrine (+2 wis)===
Going in a shrine to the Small Gods and waiting there a while gives you a +2 [[wisdom]] boost for about 15 minutes, followed by +1 [[wisdom]] for the next 15 minutes, similar to the [[Stat_effects#Ephebian_horse_.28.2B2_int.29|Ephebian horse]]'s [[intelligence]] boost.
*This can be combined with other effects without experiencing additional negative modifiers.
*These shrines can also bring you back to life if you suffer an untimely demise.

You know that you are in such a room when you get this message on entry:
&lt;pre>
You feel a sense of peace here.
&lt;/pre>

The most widely used shrine to the Small Gods is on Sinners' Walk just south of the market in [[Ohulan Cutash]].
*You regain [[gp]] and can use commands there.

The mountain shrine to the Small Gods in a cave southwest of the Giants' land also works.
*You cannot regain [[gp]] and cannot use commands in that cave.
*The cave is in a dangerous areas inhabited by yetis and lynxes that pursue and evil trolls at night that do not pursue.

There is a shrine to the Small Gods in Razorback but it doesn't provide the wisdom boost.
*You can fill a cup chained there and drink it, the ice cold water making you feel strong/agile/wise/intelligent/healthy and the reverse weak/clumsy/silly/stupid/sick but this doesn't seem to have any effect.

===[[Mazda]]'s statue (thief only +1 dex)===
If a [[thief]] fences a stolen item of sufficient value to the statue of [[Mazda]] in the entrance hall of the AM Thieves' Guild, in exchange he will bestow +1 [[dexterity]] for a short amount of time.
*The item must be stolen and expensive, this seems to be related to your [[guild level]].
*Mazda will only accept offerings from thieves.

===[[Warrior's Brain Cell]] (warriors +1 int &amp; +1 str, others: +1 str &amp; -1 int)===
When eaten, gives +1 [[intelligence]] to [[warriors]] and +1 [[strength]] and -1 [[intelligence]] to others.

===[[Wungle's Great Sucking]] (+1 con up to +3 con)===
Up to +3 [[constitution]] boost for the caster.  [[Constitution]] reduction for the victim. This can be safely combined with other stat items and effects that do not affect [[constitution]].
*A failure may cause -2 [[constitution]] for the caster.

==Negative stat effects==

===Arms, removed or on armpit (-1 to -8 dex)===

Causes:
*Casting in an area with high [[thaums]] can get your arms (or legs) torn off by the Thyngs from the [[Dungeon Dimensions]].
*A major fail when casting [[Booch's Extremal Polymorphism]] removes an arm.
*Casting [[Booch's Extremal Polymorphism]] causes the caster to grow a new arm (that doesn't fall off after a time limit) and causes all arms (including the original two) susceptible to being lost during normal combat, even if the damage is absorbed by [[shields]] or the attack is [[parry|parried]].
*Casting [[Yordon's Extremal Extension]] causes the caster to grow one extra new arm, but it falls off when the spell expires. This typically takes around 15 minutes, but a fluke cast can last 4 hours.

Penalties:
*Losing just one of your original arms -1 dex penalty.
*Losing both original arms -8 dex penalty, even if you currently have other non-standard arms.
*Having a left/right armpit arm -2 dex, or -3 dex if you have both armpit arms.

Fixing:
*You can go to the Igor in the Five Ways bell tower (under a slab) and ask him to fix you.
*Dying resets your arms to the original two, this works even if it is not a death that takes a life like a [[PK]] death, dying in the [[PK Arena]] or dying in [[CTF]].

===[[Broken leg]](s) (-3 dex per broken leg, walking on them also reduces dex, str &amp; con)===

Each broken leg gives you a penalty of -3 dexterity.
*In addition, trying to walk on broken legs reduces [[dexterity]], then [[strength]] and [[constitution]].
*The penalties to strength and constitution can be cured with [[Restore]], but will reoccur after you walk again.
*To permanently deal with broken legs, [[witches]] can [[splint]] your legs, or doctor npcs in fixed locations can "set" your legs.

===[[Burden]] (-1 to -6 dex)===

*50-74% burden results in a -1 dex penalty.
*74-99% burden results in a -2 dex penalty.
*100-124% burden results in a -3 dex penalty.
*125-149% burden results in a -4 dex penalty.
*150-174% burden results in a -5 dex penalty.
*175-200% burden results in a -6 dex penalty.

===[[Common cold]] (-1 to -6 str)===

Reduces [[strength]], stand in a smithy or take cold cure to get rid of it.
*Interacting with Pewsey around [[Granny's cottage]] in any way will give you a cold.

===[[Crawl]]ing (-5 dex)===
Reduces [[dexterity]] by 5 for as long as you're crawling.

===Cross-[[contemplate|contemplation]] (-4 int, then -2 int, then -1 int)===

[[Contemplate|Contemplating]] a spell, and then contemplating a different spell before you've fed enough gp into the first one will give you an [[intelligence]] penalty of -4, then -2, and then -1.
*The time each penalty lasts depends on an unknown factor, possibly gp used for the second contemplate or both contemplates combined, and may be any duration from less than 20 seconds to over 20 minutes.

===Donating blood (-2 con)===
Donating blood to the [[Doctors#Igor_(dark_classy_bar)|Igor]] in the side room of the [[Eateries#Dark_classy_bar|dark classy bar]] gives -2 [[constitution]] for about 15 minutes.

===Flying Cockroaches (-1 int per cockroach in your brain)===
There are flying cockroaches that flies on to you and burrows into your brain. They appear sometimes when searching a the room with the acids in the [[Alchemists' Guild]].
*For each cockroach that stays for a few seconds before you shake it off you receive -1 [[intelligence]] stat penalty for a few minutes.
*After being shaken, the cockroach returns to the room where it can try to fly back at you a few seconds later.
*[[Armour]] and [[arcane shields]] are ineffective at preventing the cockroaches from burrowing into your brain.
*A high bonus in [[dodging]] is very effective to keep them off.

===[[Fyodor's Nimbus of Porterage]] (-1 or -2 int, -2 or -3 str)===
Casting the spell [[Fyodor's Nimbus of Porterage]] results in reduced [[intelligence]] and [[strength]].  The exact amount of the reduction varies, and both stats will go back to normal over time.

===[[Gammer Shorga's Clever Creeper]] (-1 int on success, on failure -3 int)===

-1 [[intelligence]] when cast successfully for about 15 minutes.

-3 [[intelligence]] on cast failure for about 2 minutes.

===[[GP Tea]] (-1 int after)===

When you drink GP tea it gives you a boost of [[gp]]. When it expires it tries to removes the [[gp]] boost that it gave when drunk and it can give you a penalty of -1 [[intelligence]], especially if it cannot get all the [[gp]] back because it would put you below 0.

===[[Heatstroke]] (-1 to -5 int &amp; wis)===
[[Heatstroke]] will eventually give -1 to both [[intelligence]] and [[wisdom]], increasing to -2 in both somewhere around the point you are "close to death from extreme heatstroke", then increasing further to -3, then -4, then -5.
*The stat penalty can also go down while you still have heatstroke.
*A convenient place to get heatstroke is [[Sek]]'s high altar in [[Bes Pelargic]], as it is "[[temperature|incredibly, unbelievably hot]]" there.
*Stand somewhere cool, remove warm clothing to get rid of it. Heatstroke can kill.

===[[Hundred year old egg]]s (-1 to -8 dex)===

Eating one of these will make you sick, causing a gradually increasing loss of [[dexterity]] from -1 to -8.

However, if you eat a second hundred year old egg too soon after the effects of eating the first one wears off, then you just get a penalty of -2, then -1 dex for some time.

===[[Hypothermia]] (-1 to -3 con, -1 to -4 str)===

Damages [[strength]] and [[constitution]].  Stand in a smithy to get rid of it. Hypothermia can kill.

===Inhaling Water (-1 con)===

Trying to talk while underwater causes you to inhale water.  This negative effect can stack.  Your health returns to normal after about 15 minutes.

===Lead Nose (-2 con, -2 int, -2 wis)===

A lead nose from [[Who Nose]] gives you -2 to constitution, intelligence, and wisdom for as long as you wear the nose.

===[[Mocking]] yourself (-2 wis, then -1 wis)===

Each attempt to mock yourself gives you -2 [[wisdom]] for 15 minutes, then -1 wisdom for another 15 minutes for a total of 30 minutes of stat loss.

===[[Ohulan Cutash]] doctor (-1 con)===
Letting the "[[doctor]]" in Ohulan Cutash operate on you leaves you with -1 [[constitution]] for about 10 minutes.  The effect stacks--doing it twice in a row will give you -2, and so on.

[[Restore]] will remove the stat effect.

===Pandora's Box (-2 con, -2 str, +2 wis)===
Opening Pandora's Box gives you -2 [[constitution]], -2 [[strength]], and +2 [[wisdom]] for a bit, lessening to -1, -1, and +1 after a while.
*The entire stat effect lasts about half an hour, and the box explodes when opened. The effect also comes with emotes.

===Scorpion Poison Sac (-5 con, -2 dex)===

Eating a scorpion poison sac results in -5 [[constitution]] and -2 [[dexterity]].

===Scorpion Sting (-5 con, -2 dex)===
Scorpions in Djelibeybi sting everyone fighting in the room they're in. This does not make them fight the victims so they can keep stinging.
&lt;pre>The cautious scorpion viciously stabs the outgoing wealthy woman with its tail!  The outgoing wealthy woman seethes in agony.
The cautious scorpion stabs you with its tail!  You seethe in agony.
Your eyeballs melting would be less torture.&lt;/pre>
The result is a stat loss of -5 [[constitution]] and -2 [[dexterity]], like eating a scorpion poison sac.

In addition, each time you get the eyeballs melting message you seem to take about 5% [[hitpoints]] of damage.

Drinking [[antidote tea]] cures the stat loss and prevents further damage being done.

===[[Scroll]]-handling check (-1 to -3 intelligence and/or wisdom)===

 A surreptitious rustling sound starts emanating from your person.
 There is a bright flash of light as a couple of spells escape from their scrolls, leaving you slightly dazed.
 An intense flash of light bursts forth as a few spells escape from their scrolls, leaving you quite dizzy.

*This can temporarily reduce your stats, the following have recently be seen: -1 int, -2 wis; int unchanged, -3 wis.
*Sometimes this also hurts, about 100 hp damage has been seen.
*If your intelligence goes down enough, you'll fall unconscious for a while.

The following has not been seen in a while, please confirm if this happened to you in the last year:
*The reduced stats also reduces bonus. this causes an additional skillcheck against your remaining scrolls.
*The cycle of failed skillcheck -> reduced intelligence -> reduced bonus -> new skillcheck -> failed skillcheck can repeat several times, causing damage each time. This can be fatal!

===Spider Poison (-5 con, -2 dex)===
Reduces [[constitution]].

===Unquiet Spirit (fail: -1 or more con)===
Failing [[Unquiet Spirit]] can damage your [[constitution]].

===[[Wungle's Body Part Suggestion]] (-1 con or more)===
[[Constitution]] reduction for the victim while the spleen is running about, longer if the spleen runner is killed.

===[[Yarrow]] (-5 con &amp; -2 dex)===
Eating 2 handful of yarrow and waiting 2 minutes gives -5 [[constitution]] and -2 [[dexterity]].
*[[Antidote tea]] cures it.

===[[Vampire]] bite (-2 dex, -2 int, -2 str, -2 wis)===
Vampires have a special bite attack that causes temporary stat loss of -2 [[dexterity]], -2 [[intelligence]], -2 [[strength]] and -2 [[wisdom]].
*It can also make the victim stumble around and fall unconscious.

==The ''Best'' Combination==
The best stat boosting combination known gives an overall boost of +14 to stats, and is achieved as follows:

* Bless for +1 all
* Wungle's Great Sucking for +3 [[constitution]]
* Intelligence tea for +1 [[intelligence]]
* Ephebian horse for +2 [[intelligence]]
* Sek Altar for +1 [[strength]]
* Shrine for +2 [[wisdom]]
{|class="wikitable" | border="1"
 |-
 !'''Con''' !!'''Dex''' !!'''Int''' !!'''Str''' !!'''Wis'''
 |-
 | +4 || +1 || +4 || +2 || +3
|}

You can replace the bless for any stat item, for example with strength gauntlets:

* Wungle's Great Sucking for +3 [[constitution]]
* Intelligence tea for +1 [[intelligence]]
* Ephebian horse for +2 [[intelligence]]
* Strength gauntlets for +2 [[strength]]
* Sek Altar for +1 [[strength]]
* Shrine for +2 [[wisdom]]
{|class="wikitable" | border="1"
 |-
 !'''Con''' !!'''Dex''' !!'''Int''' !!'''Str''' !!'''Wis'''
 |-
 | +3 || +0 || +3 || +3 || +2
|}

=== Content from Stats ===

{| align="right"
 | __TOC__
 |}

There are five stats:
*'''[[Constitution]] (Con)''' - determines the player's ability to endure hardship, and is particularly relevant to their hit point total.
*'''[[Dexterity]] (Dex)''' - determines how nimble and agile the player is, and is particlarly relevant to covert abilities.
*'''[[Intelligence]] (Int)''' - determines the player's ability to apply logic and reason, and is particularly relevant to spellcasting.
*'''[[Strength]] (Str)''' - determines how strong a player is, and is particularly relevant to combat and [[burden]].
*'''[[Wisdom]] (Wis)''' - determines the player's ability to draw on their experience, and is particularly relevant to [[faith]].
{{-}}

==Starting out==
All players start out with 13 points in each stat.

==Viewing stats==
The 'score stats' command shows your stats.

==Changing stats==
There are a variety of ways to change one's stats:

===Permanent changes===
*The [[rearrange]] command can be used at the player's first visit to the [[retrophrenologist]].  It allows a player to set each of their stats to anywhere between 8 and 23, as long as the total of 65 is maintained.  This command can only be used once, so think carefully (and preferably take advice from your guild) before using it.  
*Additional visits to the [[retrophrenologist]] can increase one stat by one point at the expense of one point in another stat.

===Temporary changes===
*[[:Category:Stat items|Stat items]] will change a player's stats in a variety of ways when worn or wielded.
*Some [[:Category:spells|spells]] and [[:Category:Rituals|rituals]] affect the stats of their target.
*Some [[poisons]] and [[potions]] affect the stats of their target.
*All stats are lowered after [[death|dying]] and being [[Raise Dead|raised]].
*A [[burden]] of 50% or more decreases the [[dexterity]] stat.
See more on the [[Stat effects]] page.

==Stats, skills and bonuses==
All [[skills|skill bonuses]] are determined by two factors - the level to which a player has advanced in that skill, and the skill's stat dependencies.  The effect from the stats is determined by weightings that are fixed for each individual skill.

For example, consider the skill [[magic.items.scroll]].  The weights associated with this skill are:
*Con: 0
*Dex: 1
*Int: 2
*Str: 0
*Wis: 2

This skill is strongly affected by [[intelligence]] and [[wisdom]], weakly affected by [[dexterity]], and not affected at all by [[constitution]] or [[strength]].

===Summary===

For those not interested in the maths, the following are the important points of the skill/stat relationship:
*Changing a stat with a higher weighting on a skill has a bigger effect than changing a stat with a lower weighting.
*For two stats with equal weightings, changing the ''lower'' of the two will have a bigger effect than changing the higher.

===Calculations===

Each skill bonus is proportional to the ''weighted logarithmic product'' of the player's stats.  The specific relationship is:

&lt;pre> bonus = &lt;level factor> * 1/9.8 * ln(''weighted product'') - 0.25&lt;/pre>


Returning to [[magic.items.scroll]], a player with Dex: 13, Int: 18, Wis: 8 and 100 levels in this skill will have a bonus of 194, and the corresponding stat factor is:

&lt;pre>1/9.8 * ln(13 * 18 * 18 * 8 * 8) - 0.25 = 1.026&lt;/pre>

Now imagine that this player puts on a bronze helm (-3 con, +3 int, +2 wis).  How will this affect their bonus?  The stat factor is now:

&lt;pre>1/9.8 * ln(13 * 21 * 21 * 10 * 10) - 0.25 = 1.103&lt;/pre>

1.103 is 7.5% higher than 1.026, so the bonus likewise increases by 7.5% to 209.

==Stats/Skills Total Relationship==

This shows the importance of each stat and how much bonus you would get for each point you have as well as the priority based on average below.

Int: 14
Dex: 9
Wis: 5
Str: 4
Con: 2

Each point would roughly effect your entire bonuses.

This reflects every [[skill]] using the stat/skill relationship total.

=== Content from Storm ===
 | gp=35
 | learntat=45 of [[fighting.special.mounted]]
 | skills=[[fighting.special.mounted]],&lt;br>[[fighting.melee]].*
 | items=[[Mount]]
 | guild=[[Warriors]]
}}

'''Storm''' is a [[:Category:Fighting commands|fighting command]] which can be used while [[mounted]] to perform an attack on an opponent together with your [[mount]].

You can perform storm even if you are fighting, but you cannot [[charge]] while fighting.

==Acquisition==
Storm can be learned at 45 levels of [[fighting.special.mounted]] from a guild instructor or from another player who has the command.

==Syntax==
&lt;pre>storm &lt;living> at a {walk|trot|canter|gallop} with &lt;weapon>
storm &lt;living> at a {walk|trot|canter|gallop}
&lt;/pre>

==Example==
&lt;pre>You prepare to shout "DANCE OR DIE!" upon joining combat.
You hunch down over the liver chestnut horse and spur her into a walk at the cocky Tang nobleman.
You charge straight into the cocky Tang nobleman, putting all your weight into the blow.
A primal instinct adds extra weight to your cry.
You shout: DANCE OR DIE!
The cocky Tang nobleman is rocked by the bloodcurdling warcry.
You launch a powerful attack.  You chop up the large Tang bodyguard's head with your axe that marks the spot as she leaps in at the last moment to protect the cocky Tang nobleman.
The liver chestnut horse launches a powerful attack.  The liver chestnut horse tears deeply into the bold Tang bodyguard's left arm as the bold Tang bodyguard leaps in at the last moment to protect the cocky Tang nobleman.
&lt;/pre>

==Balancing Skill Check==
Not mentioned in the help file but if you are seeing "You lose your precarious attachment to &lt;horsename> the &lt;colour> horse and go flying.", then you may need some ad.ac.balancing skill. Seems to be a low requirement.

{{prebox|
storm                        Discworld command help                        storm


Name
     storm - run down someone on your horse                                     

Syntax
     storm &lt;living> at a {walk{{!}}trot{{!}}canter{{!}}gallop} with &lt;weapon>                
     storm &lt;living> at a {walk{{!}}trot{{!}}canter{{!}}gallop}                              

Description
     This command allows you to perform an attack on an opponent together  
     with your horse.  Your horse must have at least 40 intuition and you  
     must be mounted on it.                                                
                                                                           
     Your ability in fighting.special.mounted determines your ability to   
     prepare the attack, and your weapon skill determines the efficacy of  
     your attack.  It will cost you 35 fighting guild points to attempt to 
     storm.                                                                
                                                                           
     The faster you storm, the more difficult it is to prepare the attack  
     but the more powerful it will be.

=== Content from Strength ===

==Direct effects==
Strength directly affects:
*The damage caused by striking with a physical weapon.
*The ease of holding two weapons.
*The weight a player can carry before they become [[burden|burdened]].
*The weight of a player, and thus their [[Hit points|hit points]].
*[[Hit points|Hit point]] regeneration rate.

==Skill relationships==

*Strength features prominently in the [[Skills - Fighting|fighting]] skill tree, affecting almost all skills there.
*It plays a significant role in the [[Skills - Covert|covert]], [[Skills - Crafts|crafts]] and [[Skills - Adventuring|adventuring]] skill trees.
*It is not used very much in the [[Skills - Magic|magic]], [[Skills - People|people]] or [[Skills - Faith|faith]] skill trees.

==Guild reliance==

All guilds require strength to a certain degree, in order to lug whatever equipment they have around.  Beyond solving burden issues:

*[[Warriors]] and [[assassins]] often have a lot of strength due to their guilds' focus on physical combat.
*[[Priests]] and [[thieves]] also rely on physical means to deal out damage, hence usually have a reasonable level of strength.
*[[Wizards]] and [[witches]] have a lesser need for strength as:
**They can deal out magical damage in combat.
**They can summon minions (such as a [[Mother Harblist's Fruity Flyer|fruitbat]]) to carry things for them.
