=== Content from Playerkilling ===
* Playerkilling is possible on [[Discworld]] when both players are part of a common '''league'''.
* Playerkilling is also possible with your normal inventory by entering the fighting area in the [[PK Arena]] or playing in the [[Rugby field]].
* Playerkilling is also possible without your inventory (using a limited list of supplied items) in the [[Capture the flag]] arena.
* '''Player killers''' usually refers to members of the permanent leagues, but it can be used for those who are in temporary leagues as well.
* The '''[[#Playerkillers league|Playerkillers league]]''' is a permanent league that is moderated by a player called the marshal.
* The experimental '''[[#Oldschool league|Oldschool league]]''' is also a permanent league, which allows anyone to join (unless you leave, which is permanent) with no moderation nor restrictions on handling other people's corpses, see the [[#Oldschool league|section below]].
* Those who are not PK are called Non-Player Killers or NPK, although anyone can join a temporary league, becoming PK for the time of the league.
* Anyone can create temporary leagues and invite who they want, but those cannot last beyond 10 days.
* You can only interact as player killers with another player if you are in a common league.

{{warning|There are drastic changes happening to PK. See: [[Playerkilling/2020_changes]], [[Announcements#Temporary_PK.21_.28Feb_24.29|news]] and [[#Oldschool league|Oldschool]]. |inherit|red|inherit}}

=="Pk-checked"==
An action that is pk-checked generally means that players can only do it to others who are in a common league, while everyone can do the actions on [[NPC]]s.  Broadly, this applies to:
* Attacking or stealing or planting.
* Casting offensive [[spells]].
* Performing offensive [[rituals]].
* [[Pick]]ing locks on [[real estate]], although if a pk is permitted in the house then any pk can pick the lock.
* Things that interfere with covert actions such as the [[Light]] ritual and spraying [[cosmetics|perfume]].
* Placing contracts on other player killers at the various [[Assassin Guilds|assassin guilds]].
* Being [[inhumed]] by assassins who have access to the book room where the contract was purchased.
* The [[Calm]] and [[Chant]] rituals. These may, however, be performed on players who are [[group]]ed with you.
* The [[Celestial Anchor]] ritual.
* Casting the [[Nanny Revere's Traitorous Talisman]] witch spell on an item that is bonded to another player.

Actions that have less strict checks:
* [[Find Corpse]] can be used on npks, and can be used on pks if they &lt;code>permit&lt;/code> you.
* [[Tempt]] is only checked for poisoned fruit.
* [[Track]] can be used on npks.

There is also something called a '''pk assistance check''', which means that npks can't perform the action on pks who are in combat with other pks.
*This applies to the scrying systems. See [[Seeking]].

&lt;big>'''Actions that cannot be done anymore, except for members of the [[#Oldschool league|Oldschool league]]:'''&lt;/big>
* [[Corpse]] looting without being permitted.
* [[Corpse]] dragging without being permitted.
* [[Corpse]] burying.

&lt;big>'''Actions that cannot be done anymore, not announced as being back for members of Oldschool:'''&lt;/big>
* Stealing [[furniture]] and items from them without being permitted in that room or house.

==Leagues==
A league allows players to have PK interactions with other players that are in a common league.
*The [[#Playerkillers league|Playerkillers]] and [[#Oldschool league|Oldschool]] leagues are permanent.
*Any player can create temporary leagues for consensual PK with willing participants.
*An open invitation policy means that anyone can join automatically.
*A closed invitation policy requires an invitation to join.
*Leagues can now be created without theft. Please note that if two members are also in another league that does allow theft, then they can still steal from each other, since league permissions are defined by the most permissive league.

The league command is used to get information about a league or to create, join or leave a league.

*&lt;code>league list&lt;/code> - List all available leagues.
*&lt;code>league create &lt;name>&lt;/code> - Create a new temporary league.
*&lt;code>league create &lt;name> without theft&lt;/code> - Create a no-theft league.
*&lt;code>league info &lt;league>&lt;/code> - List members and other information for a league.
*&lt;code>league list members of &lt;league>&lt;/code> - List the members of a league.
*&lt;code>league list for &lt;player>&lt;/code> - List the leagues that a player is in.
*&lt;code>league join &lt;league>&lt;/code> - Join a league
*&lt;code>league leave &lt;league> for &lt;reason>&lt;/code> - Leave a league.

Temporary leagues last for 10 days, or until their creator disbands them. These are intended for player-run events, or just for sparring with friends or having a wedding brawl.

==Playerkillers league==

Changes to PK, now known as the Playerkillers league, are ongoing and the information presented here might be out of date at any given moment.
*For more information see [[Playerkilling/2020_changes|this page]] and [[Announcements#Temporary_PK.21_.28Feb_24.29|this announcement]].

Player killers (PK) are now referred to as members of the '''playerkillers league''', the permanent league of Playerkillers.
* Members of a league can kill other members of the league (and overall engage with them as a PK).
* League members who have been in the league for at least 2 days of playtime (or everyone who was a PK at the time of the change) can vote in an election for league leader.
* This election uses preference-based voting.
* Candidates need someone in the league to second them.
* NPKs are allowed to stand for the position of PK leader.

The elected '''Leader of PK''', a player, has the following powers:
* remove someone from the league (all members will get an inform about this)
* invite someone to the league who was previously removed (or is too young to join)
* see when someone previously left (and whether it was voluntary or not)
* write a message in the league log file for future leaders to see (for example to note why a player was removed)

It has been stated that the leader of PK can be removed through an option to hold a vote of non-confidence (VONC), which has now been implemented.

Currently the commands for PK status changes and information are available with the &lt;code>league&lt;/code> command:
*&lt;code>league list members of Playerkillers&lt;/code> - List the members of the Playerkillers league.
*&lt;code>league join Playerkillers&lt;/code> - Become a player killer.
*&lt;code>league info Playerkillers&lt;/code> - List members and other information for the Playerkillers league.
*&lt;code>league leave Playerkillers&lt;/code> - Stop being a player killer.

 marshal: Reva
 Officers: Eviscerator and Kwik
 Policy: The league has an open invitation policy: everyone is free to join, except for those who have previously left or been removed.  (These players need to be invited before being able to join.)  Once you have joined, you must play for a full day before being able to leave.

==Oldschool league==

An experimental (possibly) permanent PK league was added on 31 July 2021 with the following (announced) characteristics compared to other leagues :
*Corpse looting is allowed.
*Corpse dragging is allowed.
*Corpse burying is allowed.
*Everyone is welcomed to join (once) even if banned from the [[#Playerkillers league|Playerkillers league]].
*If you cannot join because you have been banned from the [[#Playerkillers league|Playerkillers league]] or because you don't have enough playtime you can contact the league marshall to request an invitation.
*No one will be banned from the league and complaints will probably be answered by suggesting to &lt;code>league leave Oldschool for &lt;reason>&lt;/code>, which will be permanent.
*You can leave the league (after playing a full day) at anytime, but once you leave you cannot come back.

See below for the announcements.

As requested, I have now added a second permanent league called Oldschool. For technical reasons, it cannot be leaderless, so for now, Dare has been set as the leader; leadership is not by election, but can be passed to others. When I get around to it, the ability to loot, drag and bury corpses will be reinstated without prior warning, so please take this into account before joining.

Please note that this is an experiment to see whether a second league is sustainable. There will be no dedicated talker channel or board (at least not from the start); these may be added later if the league is a success. If the league ends up being inactive and not used, it'll eventually be removed. It is up to its members to keep it alive.

To become a member, use: league join oldschool

Note that it is possible to both be a member of Playerkillers and Oldschool. Note also that you can leave any league, but will probably not be able to ever rejoin.

Oldschool PK
Note #98 by Dare at Sat Jul 31 11:41:17 2021 [EST] on board frog

PK is back.

No rules, no liaisons, no bans, no bs.

All the grief you can handle, plus all the grief you can't.

You will be robbed. You will be looted. Your corpse will be dragged and buried or ritburied. You will be killed over and over, and no one will care no matter how much you cry.

Pure PK chaos like we used to do it.

If there are any questions about details just ask and I'll get the answers for you when I can.

Everyone is welcome. If you have been banned from PK contact me and I will invite you in. You're always welcome, no matter how much of a monster you are.

The only catch is if you quit, you can never come back.

Don't be a quitter. Be a killer.

Magistrate Juppie's advice is good, and while former magistrate Dare
also seems to be trying to help everybody out, such threats were of
course more effective when people could not simply leave the league.
So it would be even more helpful if the oldschool PKs simply did their
corpse looting in the wide lawless areas outside Ankh-Morpork (and
Djelibeybi for that matter) - I suspect that the members of the new
league do not expect to be exempt from the rules of what may happen on
guild grounds either.

At any rate, the rules againt corpse looting and dragging were passed
in 2001, which should be sufficiently early to qualify as oldschool
for most people. If instead you prefer the late 1990s' situation, then
maybe you should petition for the removal of life taking contracts. ;)

Jeanie.

[[Category:Concepts]]

=== Content from Poison ===

There are many sources of '''poison''' on the Disc with various effects.

The effects of a poison can either be instant, regularly distribution over time or increasing over time.

==Effects==
The negative effects can be:
* [[stat effects]] such as lowered [[constitution]] and/or other [[stats]]
* [[health]] damage
* loss of [[guild points]]
* temporarily losing [[commands]] or [[spells]]
* making the victim burp, vomit or other actions that bring the victim out of [[hiding]]
* making it harder to use [[commands]] such as [[hide]], to [[cast]] [[spells]], perform [[rituals]]
* [[death]], however this is accomplished by getting the [[health points]] of the victim to zero

==Food, drink and other substances==
Several poisons are delivered by [[Food and drink|eating, drinking]] or otherwise consuming [[poisonous]] items:
*[[Herbs]]
**[[Angel's Trumpet]]
**[[Attamno]]
**[[Belladonna]]
**[[Blue Lotus]]
**[[Bryony]]
**[[Cereus]]
**[[Clematis]]
**[[Foxglove]]
**[[Hellebore]]
**[[Hemlock]]
**[[Monkshood]]
**[[Oleander]]
**[[Poisoned apple]]
**[[Shiny black berries]]
**[[Skullcap]]
**[[Sprig of mistletoe]]
**[[White lotus]]
**[[Wormwood]]
**[[Yarrow]]: -5 constitution and -2 dexterity, repeated health drain
*[[Fruits]]
**[[Green billet apple]]
**[[Poisoned apple]]: -5 constitution and -2 dexterity, repeated health drain, vomiting and sweating that bring you out of hiding
**[[Shiny black berry]]
*[[Corpse parts]]
**[[Blowfish poison sac]]
**Horned viper poison sac
**Scorpion poison sac
*Other consumables and areas
**[[Energy tea]]
**Smoking [[narcotics]] like hashish, badly rolled cigarettes; drinking cream of frog; eating some mushrooms or frog pills or simply breathing some fumes can give poisonous effects
**Toxic air in the lower levels of the [[Grflx caves]] poisons you just for breathing.
**Drinking [[#Poison creation|created poisons]] is most unwise and will be sure to have maximal effect on the drinker.
[[Witches]] can [[tempt]] people into eating [[fruit]]s even if they are poisoned.

==Poison creation==
&lt;onlyinclude>Players can make some '''[[poison]]s''', '''smoke bombs''' and combining the two '''gas bombs'''.

Warning: Some people consider created poisons to be secret and similar to [[quests]] in that knowing everything about it can ruin one's fun of discovering it by yourself. It can be frowned upon to publicly ask or discuss the specifics of poison making or other aspects of created poisons. Finally, some guilds of assassins have rules against selling or giving poisons made in their poison labs.

Sensitive information about poisons are hidden until you highlight it or edit the page. The pages about poison making have been moved to the Poison namespace to hide them from default search parameters and direct links.

Please note that making poisons is [[dangerous]] and can lead to [[dying]].&lt;/onlyinclude>&lt;noinclude>

To get more information about creating poisons, follow [[Poison:Poison creation|this link]] (at your own peril).&lt;/noinclude>

==Weapons==
Some weapons have poison built into them:
*[[Rune-covered sickle]], a [[misc weapons|misc weapon]] that can only be wielded by someone who has done a specific quest.
*[[Ornate warhammer]], a [[maces|mace weapon]] that poisons opponents with the right set of personal [[tactics]] settings.
*[[Poniard]], a [[daggers|dagger]] that poisons the wielder if not skilled enough.
*[[Dark-bladed poniard]], a [[daggers|dagger]] that poisons the wielder if not skilled enough.
*[[Venom-coated dagger]], an unrepairable [[daggers|dagger]] that poisons opponents.

==Attacks==
There are also other ways to get poisoned:
*[[Blowfish]]
*[[Scorpion]]s can sting opponents and those in [[Djelibeybi]] join in fights without being attacked.
*[[Spider]]s can poison when dealing damage, especially [[giant spider]]s from [[Gloomy Forest]]. Even worst are [[Queen Shelox]] and the [[vicious spider]]s guarding her.
*The [[horned viper]] is a poisonous [[snake]].
*Powerful [[insects]] from a [[bug shield]] can poison the opponent that is dealing damage being absorbed by the bug shield.

==Traps==
Some [[traps]] on doors or containers can poison you when trying to [[pick]], open or go through them. You can use [[probe]] to try to see if there is a trap and a successful [[disarm]]ing of the trap can prevent it from hurting you.

==Curing==
[[Witches]] can brew [[antivenom]] tea that instantly cures many types of poison if enough is drunk. This often includes stat loss. If not, the [[restore]] ritual can remove [[stat loss]].

The [[Soothing Rain]] ritual also cures poisoning.

Higher levels of [[constitution]] reduce the poisoning time from various sources.

Being in a [[safe zone]] prevents the effects of poisons from damaging you, allowing it to expire after a while.

[[Category:Afflictions]]

=== Content from Position ===

Your position is visible to anyone who is in the room you're in, or who can see into it.  It also puts a [[description line#position|line in your description]].  By default, you will normally be "standing".  Leaving a room will clear your position and--usually--change it to "standing".

==Built-in positions==
There are several innate commands that change your position.  They are:
*crouch: changes your position to "crouching"
*kneel: changes your position to "kneeling"
*lie: changes your position to "lying"
*lounge: changes your position to "lounging"
*meditate: changes your position to "meditating".  If used at a [[high altar]], has [[meditate|other functions]].
*sit: changes your position to "sitting"
*squat: changes your position to "squatting"
*stand: changes your position to "standing"

These are usable whenever you are on land.

==Custom positions==
You can use the "position" command to set your position to something arbitrary, like so:
&lt;pre>position &lt;new position>&lt;/pre>

This costs 100 [[social points]].  The position you use cannot be more than forty characters.  It also cannot contain numbers, punctuation, or the words "selling" or "teaching", and you will get this message if you try to set a position with those things:
&lt;pre>You cannot bring yourself to set that position.&lt;/pre>

==Other things that change your position==
*Entering [[combat]] will cause you to stand up--although people looking into the room will see "&lt;player> is fighting" rather than "&lt;player> is standing".
*[[Water room]]s will generally set your position to "swimming".
*Rooms that you get to by [[climbing]], such as up a tree or on a wall, may well set your position to something appropriate when you climb into them.
*Interacting with parts of a room may change your position; for example, if you leap on the stumps in the [[Guild of Assassins]] courtyard, it will show that you are leaping on the stumps while you are doing so--and if you fall, it will change your position to lying.
*[[Crawl]]ing changes your position to "crawling", and will cause you to be "crawling" instead of "standing" when you enter a room.  Changing your position will cause you to stop crawling.
*[[Pray]]ing can change your position (to lying or kneeling), depending on how much gp you use.
*The [[Mugwuddle's Muddling Mirage]] spell, and similar effects, will change the target's position to "wandering around within a shimmering bauble" for the duration of the effect.
*The "fall" [[soul]] will change your position to "lying".

==Changing others' positions==
If you use the "push" [[soul]] on someone, it will cause them to sit down if they are standing, or lie down otherwise.  Similarly, if you use the "throw" soul on someone, it causes them to lie down.  Both of these work whether or not you're in the same room with someone and, oddly, you can do either soul on yourself.

Some [[pet]]s may be asked to sit.

==Furniture==
Rooms may have items that you can have your position interact with in some fashion.  For example, at a high altar you can "sit on altar" and your position will become "You are sitting on &lt;furniture>".  If you then change your position to any of the built-in ones or set it with the position command, you will remain on that piece of furniture--for example, if you are sitting on a piece of furniture, and then "stand", your position will change to "You are standing on &lt;furniture>".  If you want to get off the furniture, you can "stand on floor" (or sit, lie, etc., "on floor").  Leaving the room will also work.

Some kinds of buyable [[furniture]] can also be interacted with in this way.

The spell "Pragi's Fiery Gaze" (abbreviated as '''PFG''') is an offensive spell requiring an eye. It causes all potential enemies within the caster's room to be struck with a burst of fire based damage. Some unexpected characters not usually considered enemies, such as pets, may be affected. 

==Effects==
A successful cast will cause fire damage to all potential targets in the room, regardless of how many targets that may be.  It will not damage members of your group, and it is PK-checked.  Enemies resistant to fire damage will take severely reduced damage, such as trolls.  Your magic.spells.offensive bonus, and the average bonus of your methods, influence the damage.

The damage formula is:
((offensive + average of methods) / 2) * 1 to 5

For example, say your bonuses are 450 offensive, 300 fire, 330 evoking, 330 enchanting, 350 animating, 380 channeling (averaging 338 for the 5 methods). (450 + 338) / 2 = 394. The damage multiplier for Pragi's Fiery Gaze is x1 to x5, so you will deal between 394 and 1970 damage (average 1182) determined randomly to each target hit by the spell.

*Smoke from a failed PFG can cause enemies to leave the room.

==Casting==
This spell costs 40 GP to cast, and takes up 30 units of [[mind space]].  It takes no target and affects potential enemies in the same room as the caster.  This spell is PK checked.

=== Content from Pray ===

The pray command is learned upon joining a faith.

'''Pray''' is a command that both priests and followers get automatically upon joining a faith.  It will channel some, or all, of your guild points to your deity.  Its main purpose is to help with [[alignment]].  However, praying normally also charges [[faith rods]] and fills the [[deity pool]].

==Syntax==
Available syntaxes are:
&lt;pre>pray 
pray {gently|lengthily|vigorously|fervently}
pray to &lt;deity>
pray to &lt;deity> {gently|lengthily|vigorously|fervently}
pray {gently|lengthily|vigorously|fervently} to &lt;deity>
pray for &lt;player>
&lt;/pre>
The first syntax spends all your faith guild points on praying for yourself.  It will automatically have you pray to the deity you worship.

The second syntax will have you spend 20%, 40%, 60%, or 80% of your (current) faith gp on praying for yourself (depending on which adjective you use).  It also automatically has you pray to the correct deity.

The third syntax is like the first syntax, except that you can specify the deity to pray to.  It's therefore less safe than the first.

The fourth and fifth syntaxes are like the second syntax, except that, as with the third, you can choose the deity to pray to.

The fifth syntax has you spend all your faith guild points on a prayer for someone else.

While [[Followers#Supplication|supplicating]], you can only "pray to &lt;deity>", and only at their high altar.

[[Wizard|Wizards]] and [[Witch|witches]] only see the pray command with a single syntax line (pray to &lt;deity>) when standing at a deity's high altar. It yields the result:
 You somehow get the feeling that you are being ignored.
and if you try to pray to another god:
 You might just be better off trying to pray to Gufnork while you are in His temple.
Neither consume gp.

==Praying for yourself==
This reminds Him or Her of your existence, and if you are not at your deity's perfect [[Alignment|alignment]] will move you towards it. How effective your prayer will be in doing this is determined by your skill in [[faith.rituals.special]] and the gp you spend.

If you are a priest, then the deity pool will get 1/10th of the gp spent, or 1/8th if you're at your high altar.
Followers contribute 1/13th of spent gp to the pool, or 1/11th at their high altar.

If you do not want to spend all your gp on a pray, the options and approximate proportion of your current gp are:
*20% gp - pray gently
*40% gp - pray lengthily
*60% gp - pray vigorously
*80% gp - pray fervently
You need to pray at least 50gp.

There is another skill check involved with praying, which appears to use [[faith.rituals.special]] and the amount of gp you spend.  Praying also seems to be harder the further you are from perfect alignment.  If you fail this skill check, you will get a message about being distracted as you pray and will not receive the full amount of command xp you would otherwise.  The effect on deity points and alignment shift is not known.  As well as no extra message at all for a normal prayer, you may get "Your prayers come to your lips with ease" which signifies a better than usual prayer.  The effect in practical terms is not known.  An even better prayer is accompanied by  "You clear your mind and focus on the glory of [your deity]".  This has moved you into ideal alignment, and may have involved a much larger shift in alignment than you would normally get.

You'll find it easier to perform rituals right after you prayed. Whether praying has long-term effect on rituals or not, has not yet been established. To be eligible for election to the High Priesthood, you also need to have prayed in the last 10 days or so.  You also need to have prayed enough, recently enough, to use the [[consecrate]] command.

===Messages===
The following pray messages were originally gathered by Milly, Emiko and Jeanie, but the amounts of gp involved have since been changed.  There also appears to be some other factor involved (likely [[faith.rituals.special]]), since it's possible for one person to have fewer gp than another person, yet consistently get a higher pray message when praying fully.  Whether or not the deity pool is full can also affect what message you get--a full pray may (barely) get you a higher-level message when the pool is full, and a message one level lower when it's not. &lt;!--This is *very* consistent for me. --~~~~ -->  Therefore, the amounts of gp listed are merely examples and the ranges have some overlap.

:52-63 gp
::You briefly bow your head and mutter a few quick words in praise of Pishe, Goddess of Slight Showers.
::Milly the milkmaid briefly bows her head and mutters something.
:78-116 gp 
::You spend a moment with your head bowed praising Pishe, Goddess of Slight Showers.
::Milly the milkmaid spends a moment in thought with her head bowed.
:132-186 gp 
::You lower yourself to your knees and silently offer up a short prayer to Pishe, Goddess of Slight Showers.
::You silently offer up a short prayer to Sandelfon, God of Corridors.  [already kneeling]
::Milly the milkmaid gets down on her knees and spends a short time in silence.
:204-276 gp 
::You quietly recite a lengthy hymn of praise to Pishe, Goddess of Slight Showers, while kneeling.
::Milly the milkmaid seems to spend some time talking to herself while kneeling.
:304-388 gp
::You prostrate yourself on the ground and speak at some length to Pishe, Goddess of Slight Showers.
::Milly the milkmaid falls flat on her face and spends some time talking to the ground.
:420-469 gp 
::You prostrate yourself before the vision of Pishe, Goddess of Slight Showers, that appears before you and pray loudly and at great length.
::Milly the milkmaid prostrates herself and shouts praise to Pishe, Goddess of Slight Showers.
:441-? gp
::You kneel before a faint vision of Fish, God of Sea Creatures, which appears to you and utter a series of soft prayers.
::You utter a series of soft prayers as a faint vision of Sandelfon, God of Corridors, appears to you. [already kneeling]
::Inige Willows kneels and prays quietly for a few moments.
:next:
::You kneel as the image of Fish, God of Sea Creatures, appears in front of you, bowing your head and praying at length.
::Inige Willows kneels and bows his head, reciting a lengthy prayer.
:next:
::You bow before the glowing figure of Fish, God of Sea Creatures, which appears in front of your eyes, speaking humble words of worship and praise.
::Inige Willows bows slightly and mumbles a few soft words.
:next
::You stand before the radiant figure of Fish, God of Sea Creatures, which appears in front of you, praying softly.
::Inige Willows looks distant for a moment as he mumbles a few soft words and a faint glow surrounds him.

==Praying to the wrong deity==
Praying to the wrong deity (by specifically using "pray to &lt;some deity other than the one you worship>") will leave you suffering your own deity's wrath for a time.  This has the following effects:
*You'll be unable to perform rituals, use [[bestow]], [[consecrate]], or perform [[ritual burial]]s.
*You'll be unable to pray for other people.
*Normal prayers from you won't fill the deity pool or charge faith rods, and will use all your faith gp even if you were trying to use less.
*"Score align" will tell you that your deity is "extremely angry with you", regardless of your alignment.

This lasts for between fifteen and sixteen minutes.

You'll also get a powerful [[wrath]] put on you, giving you -1 to all your stats.  This seems to last around thirteen to sixteen minutes from the last time you did it (in other words, it doesn't stack if you do it multiple times, just renews).  When it wears off, you get the message that "The higher being is no longer watching you."  It can wear off before the other effects do.

{{Prebox|You hear a booming voice resonating in your head.
Pishe, Goddess of Slight Showers tells you: Oh dear, an apostate, are you?  I shall give you some time to rethink your prayers to Sarduk.
&lt;br>You feel the attention of a higher being watching your every move.}}
{{Prebox|You hear a booming voice resonating in your head.
Pishe, Goddess of Slight Showers tells you: You really, really, shouldn't have done that.
&lt;br>The higher being takes a renewed interest in your actions.}}
{{Prebox|You hear a booming voice resonating in your head.
Pishe, Goddess of Slight Showers tells you: And I thought that you were one of my faithful.
&lt;br>The higher being takes a renewed interest in your actions.}}

Doing this will use all your faith gp, regardless of whether you tried to pray with less gp.  Additionally, this type of praying doesn't add any [[deity points]] to the pool and doesn't charge faith rods.

==Praying for others==
Priests and followers can pray for someone else of the same faith, as well, which moves ''their'' alignment instead of that of the person praying.  This type of prayer doesn't add anything to the deity pool&lt;!-- Either for the person praying, or for the person they're praying for.--~~~~ -->, and doesn't seem to charge [[faith rods]].  It uses all your faith gp and doesn't change your position.  It's also invisible to other people unless you're in the same room with the person you're praying for&lt;!--I checked--you don't see anything if you're only in the room with either the person praying, or the person they're praying for. --~~~~ -->.

You can pray for someone who is [[Followers#Changing gods|supplicating]] to join your faith, aiding them in their efforts.

If you're ignoring someone, they can't pray for you.  When someone prays for you, you get a message about it:
{{Prebox|&lt;Player> prays to &lt;Deity> on your behalf.}}
{{Prebox|&lt;Player> prays to &lt;Deity> on your behalf.  You feel slightly closer to &lt;Deity>.}}
{{Prebox|&lt;Player> prays to &lt;Deity> on your behalf.  Your spirits are slightly uplifted by the prayer.}}
{{Prebox|&lt;Player> prays to &lt;Deity> on your behalf.  You feel quite a bit closer to &lt;Deity>.}}
If it's too dark to see anything where you are, you'll see that "someone" prayed for you instead of the name of the player who did.

If you're in the same room as them, the messages are different:
{{Prebox|&lt;Player> lays his hand on you and prays to &lt;Deity> on your behalf.}}
{{Prebox|&lt;Player> lays her hand on you and prays to &lt;Deity> on your behalf.  You feel slightly closer to &lt;Deity>.}}
{{Prebox|&lt;Player> lays his hand on you and prays to &lt;Deity> on your behalf.  Your spirits are slightly uplifted by the prayer.}}
{{Prebox|&lt;Player> lays his hand on you and prays to &lt;Deity> on your behalf.  You feel quite a bit closer to &lt;Deity>.}}
It's not clear, as yet, exactly what the messages mean, although the first one in each list seems to happen when the target of the prayer is already in ideal alignment.

The messages the person praying gets are different, too:
{{Prebox|You pray to &lt;Deity> on behalf of &lt;Player>, asking Him to assist His child.}}
{{Prebox|You pray to &lt;Deity> on behalf of &lt;Player>, requesting that He bring His servant closer to Him.}}

And in the same room:
{{Prebox|You lay your hand on &lt;Player> and pray to &lt;Deity> on his behalf, asking Him to assist His child.}}
{{Prebox|You lay your hand on &lt;Player> and pray to &lt;Deity> on her behalf, requesting that He bring His servant closer to Him.}}
{{Prebox|You lay your hand on &lt;Player> and pray to &lt;Deity> on her behalf, imploring Him to forgive her sins.}}

If you're in the same room with them, other people in that room see a message like this:
{{Prebox|&lt;Player> prays to &lt;Deity> on behalf of &lt;Player>.}}

=== Content from Preserve ===
 |gp=10 per item
 |learntat=? [[crafts.culinary.preserving]]
 |skills=[[crafts.culinary.preserving]]
 |items=5 pinches of sea salt
}}

'''Preserve''' is a command to cure something with '''salt''' so that it does not spoil.

:For the witch spell that can preserve food (by drying), see [[Mama Blackwing's Potent Preserver]].

For other means to preserve, see [[Pickling]].

==Command details==
The preserve command requires some skills in [[crafts.culinary.preserving]] to learn and use.

It cannot be taught by other players. It is taught as part of a quest. Spoiler: {{Fontcolor|black|black|Look for a hut on the beach near the road between Holy Wood and Ankh-Morpork. Might need to go during the night.}}

Syntax:
 preserve &lt;object>    Preserve a food item or a body part with salt.

*Salt can be kept in a container identified as a "component pouch" and it will be automatically retrieved for preservations.
*You can attempt to preserve multiple items at once - this costs 10 GP and 5 pinches of salt per item, and the time taken to preserve increases for each item. This requires a higher preserving bonus.
*Each attempt to preserve uses 5 pinches of sea salt per item, which is lost if you fail the skillcheck.
*Objects preserved become cured &lt;object>.
*If you have too many items carried it fails more.
*If your hands are not empty it fails more.

==Salt==
How to obtain salt:
*Salt can be obtained by putting sea water inside a salt pan and waiting. This seems to take a couple of minutes during a clear day, but it does not seem to work at all at night.
*The correct water looks like &lt;code>seawater&lt;/code> and when you look at it &lt;code>clear, very salty liquid that smells faintly of seaweed&lt;/code>.
*There's a salt pan you can purchase, which is [[furniture]]. The other salt pans cannot be moved.
*Once some of the seawater evaporates you can take the salt from the salt pan. You'll need to empty and refill the pan if you want more salt.
*Swimming at the surface of the ocean will fill opened vessels when you enter the room.
*Water from the sea in [[Brown Islands]] works and is easy/safe to get.
*Using other containers does not seem to work.

=== Content from Protect ===

If you use this command without any arguments it shows who is protecting you and who you are protecting in the room.

Conversely, to stop protecting someone, you can '''unprotect'''.

===Syntax===

&lt;pre>
> protect &lt;living>
You move to protect &lt;living>.

> protect
No one is protecting you.
Of the people in this room, you are protecting &lt;living>.

> unprotect &lt;living>
You stop protecting &lt;living>.
&lt;/pre>

===Mechanics===

*Protecting someone means that you will jump in front of as many attacks against the protected being as you can, but unlike [[defend]] which will try to [[parry]] the attacks, you will receive the hits without trying to parry, block or dodge them.

*Without armour or arcane protection, protect involves a great deal of risk as you are losing HP on their behalf.

*A decent [[armour]] and arcane protections such as [[Major Shield|Major]]/[[Minor Shield|Minor]] Shield, [[Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator|TPA]] and [[Bug shield]] can help keep you alive by absorbing damage that would otherwise reduce your HP. It is also advisable to have a lot of HP, more than 2500, so that shields that expire and special attacks do not kill you before you can react.

*Protecting someone from an attack will pull you into combat with any enemies that are attempting to harm your ward.

*When Protecting someone, you use up a decent chunk of [[Action Points|AP]], as such, you may make fewer/no attack per round, and stop moving to defend yourself from incoming attacks if your ward is attacked multiple times. On the other hand, it costs less AP to Protect someone than to [[Defend]] them.

*It is very possible for you to die on someone else's behalf if you are Protecting them. Unless you unprotect when your HP is low you will continue to leap in front of attacks until you die.

*While casting [[spells]] you will not leap in front of anyone you are protecting, essentially making the caster not protect while casting. This means that your ward will have to deal with all the attacks as if you were not protecting.

{{Infobox command
 | gp=35
 | learntat=15 [[fighting.special.unarmed]]
 | skills=[[Fighting.special.unarmed]] and [[Fighting.unarmed.striking]]
}}
==Targeted Punches==
While using 'punch' results in an untargeted strike against a random body zone the player can also specify a target.  See 'syntax punch' in-game for specifics.

You can punch a target in the stomach, arms and face.

Using the syntax 'punch compare x with y' you can compare two target zones.  Use 'body' to represent an untargeted punch in compare.  

Targeted punches are all harder to prepare and deal more damage than unfocused.
 In order of difficulty and damage, lowest first.
 unfocused, arms, kidneys, stomach, solar plexus, face

==Notes==
* Unlike [[Kick]], punch requires at least one hand free.
* Punch is also a soul command.  If the target of your punch cannot be found in the room then you will soul instead. Use 'nosoul punch &lt;target>' to avoid this behaviour.

=== Content from Pursue ===

It is also possible to suppress your ability to evade and lead on someone with the setting:
&lt;pre>
options combat suppress_evade=on
&lt;/pre>
Those who are being led in this fashion get skill checks to notice this.

NPCs who use the pursuit command are fairly rare.  Some--like [[cheetah]]s--only pursue if you attack them, while others--like [[Coffee Nostra families#Coffee_Nostra_hitman|Coffee Nostra hitmen]], [[lynx]]es, [[yeti]], and [[ice giant]]s--pursue and then attack ''you''.  They may stop pursuing after some time has passed.

[[Ankh-Morpork#Crime_and_Punishment|Watchmen]] will also pursue, but even [[Angua|Captain Angua]] won't actually kill you.

==Delayed pursuit==
Some npcs use another form of pursuit when in combat.  This isn't the same as the command, and they don't follow you into the room immediately--instead, they enter the room they saw you go into after several seconds.

Many npcs in cities use this.

}}

Repair is a command which allows you to attempt to improve the condition of a '''wooden''' or '''bone''' item in your inventory.  

==Command details==
The repair command requires 10 levels of crafts.carpentry to learn, and is usually taught by other players.  It can also be taught by Jack MacLumber in the Woodcutters' Guild in [[Bois]] and by Tony Dorf in [[Ankh-Morpork]].

To tell if an item could be repaired if it's just a little bit damaged and can't even be referred to as &lt;code>damaged&lt;/code>, you can do &lt;code>repair cost &lt;item>&lt;/code> in a [[woodworking shop]] or [[launder room]].

Each repairing attempt usually costs 35 craft GP and requires you to be in a [[wood workshop]].

Each repair attempt will cost some local money, usually not much.  This amount can vary between wood workshops, and is influenced by the repairer's skills and the condition of the item / amount of improvement, and other factors.

Your bonus in various crafts.carpentry skills determines your success and how much the condition of the item is improved.

Attempting to repair a severely damaged item with low skills may result in destroying the item.

==Skills used==
According to the helpfile, normally the skill used is crafts.carpentry.whittling.

When repairing furniture, crafts.carpentry.furniture is used instead.

=== Content from Retrophrenologist ===

==Retroing==
If you're not happy with your current stat arrangement, and you have already rearranged (or don't want to yet), you can get a retrophrenologist to permanently move a point from one stat to another.  You can't make a stat (permanently) lower than 8 or higher than 23 this way.

Saying "help" gets their attention; after that you may have to say "yes" multiple times.  They will ask you which stat you want to decrease and which one you want to increase, then tell you how much it will cost and ask you to confirm.

After you confirm, they'll take your money and perform the operation.  This will leave you [[unconscious]] for five minutes and with severe temporary penalties to ''all'' of your stats for roughly an hour after that.  Notably, your lowered strength is likely to cause you to drop anything you aren't wearing (including money), so you should put everything besides the retrophrenologist's fee in worn containers if you don't want to drop it.  The stat penalties last a while, although the [[Restore]] ritual can fix it. You can be restored before you regain consciousness, so it is worthwhile to contact a Pishite before getting knocked out.

===Cost===
The base cost is {{Dollars|$100}} multiplied by the total number of retrophrenology moves you've made in total - so your first move would be {{Dollars|$100}}, the second would be {{Dollars|$200}}, the third {{Dollars|$300}} etc. - however, there is a premium for making multiple moves in a short space of time.

Whenever you pay for a move, the price for the NEXT move is immediately set to {{Dollars|$14100}} multiplied by the total moves you've made... so immediately following your first move, a 2nd move would cost you {{Dollars|$14100}}. Immediately following your second move, the price of a 3rd move would be {{Dollars|$28200}}... a 4th move would be {{Dollars|$42300}}, then {{Dollars|$56400}} etc.

However, the price will drop by {{Dollars|$100}} multiplied by the total moves you've made, every real-time roundworld day. So after your very first retro visit, it would take 140 roundworld days (or 20 weeks) for the price to drop by {{Dollars|$100}} a day from {{Dollars|$14100}} to the new base price of {{Dollars|$200}}.  If you then purchased a 2nd move at this price, the cost for a 3rd move would immediately jump to {{Dollars|$28200}}, and would then drop by {{Dollars|$200}} every roundworld day, again taking 140 roundworld days.

In short, if you want the cheapest possible moves, you will need to wait 140 roundworld days between each every move to only ever pay the "base cost", which for a total of 5 moves would cost {{Dollars|$1500}} and take 560 days, or 80 weeks to do.  But there is nothing other than price stopping you doing all fives moves in the same day - which would cost you {{Dollars|$141100}}.

==Rearranging==
If you have not rearranged yet, you can go to a retrophrenologist and say "rearrange" to start the process.  This lets you change your stats according to your preferences, with some restrictions: a stat may not be less than 8 or greater than 23, and all your stats can add up to at most 65.  As you must "say rearrange", pay attention to the language you are using. 60 levels in the retrophrenologist's language seems to be enough.

This is free, but you may only do it once.  It's therefore advisable to make sure you know what you're doing first, since your rearrange affects all your skills, your regeneration rates for [[gp]] and [[hp]], the amount you can carry, and other things.

Unlike retroing, you will not end up unconscious when you rearrange, nor will you suffer penalties to your stats. It is no longer necessary to go to a retrophrenologist in order to rearrange, and all newbies start with the [[rearrange]] command.

==Locations==
*Zorgo the Retrophrenologist sets up shop in [[Ankh-Morpork]], in the Isle of Gods.
*Mr Ralph Womblefluff in [[Ohulan Cutash]] has his operating room on Long Alley.
*Ptricza Ptrete's house of retrophrenology is on Ephebe Road in [[Djelibeybi]], near its northeast end.
*Ral-Fee's Retro-Spa is on Onetwolong Avenue in [[Bes Pelargic]] (running along the southern edge of the city on the west side).
*Vinred's tent in the North-West of the [[Oasis]] where Ephebian speakers can get an initial rearrange.

==Notes==
Attacking/attempting to kill a retrophrenologist NPC anywhere, will cause ALL retrophrenologists across the Disc to all hate you.  Attempting to enter any Retrophrenologist room anywhere afterwards will cause you to be immediately knocked unconscious for 5 roundworld minutes, and thrown to the outside room.  This effect lasts an unknown (currently) amount of time, but at least several months (?).

Attempting to get a killing blow on a retrophrenologist will cause them to steal all of your money - all coins on you, all coins in any container on you, regardless of how much you have, with no way to retrieve the money afterwards.

'''Riposte''' is a [[:Category:Fighting commands|fighting command]] which can be used to rapidly counterstrike against an opponent following a successful [[parry]], providing an almost free attack.

==Execution==
Riposte may be only be performed when armed, and when the player's [[Tactics#Response|tactics-response]] is set to either 'parry' or 'neutral'. Command help describes riposte as a thrust attack and it seems to only work with weapons that can either [[Stab]] or [[Pierce]]. You need sufficient Strength relative to the weight of the weapon (see [[Research:Riposte]]).

Riposting is a three-stage process:
#The player must pass a [[fighting.special.weapon]] skillcheck in order to prepare the command.
#They must then successfully [[parry]] an incoming attack against the opponent on whom they are executing the riposte.
#They then perform a normal skillcheck of their appropriate [[fighting.melee]] weapon skill for an extra attack.

==Effects==
Riposte gives the player a single extra attack that has a very low [[action point]] cost{{research}}.  Note that a riposte attack is essentially a normal attack - it doesn't do significantly more damage than normal&lt;!--Chat: Though I have a theory that it does nevertheless do some more damage than normal - any PKs feel like researching?-->, and it can be defended against just like any other attack.

=== Content from Roleplaying ===
'''Roleplaying''' is when a person, often referred to as a '''roleplayer''' or '''RPer''', creates a persona for their game character and acts as that character during interactions. When playing Discworld MUD, many players choose to create engaging narratives and character-driven interactions instead of focusing on the game's mechanics or competition.

==In and out of character==
Roleplayers often differentiate between ''In-Character'' (IC) and ''Out-of-Character'' (OOC) interactions. When IC, roleplayers are often fully immersed in their character's persona, responding and acting as they would in the world of the Disc. OOC is when you step out of your character to chat with friends or discuss game mechanics as a roundworld player rather than your Discworld character. Some players enjoy balancing their time between IC and OOC, while others prefer to remain fully IC throughout their entire gameplay.

Often, roleplayers will use [[groups]], [[clubs]] or &lt;code>[[tell]]&lt;/code> to communicate out of character during a scene, while &lt;code>say&lt;/code> and &lt;code>[[emote]]&lt;/code> will be used to communicate in character.

===Creator interaction===
When interacting with [[creators]] or [[liaisons]], it's important to remember that these interactions are considered out-of-character. Creators are there to help keep the MUD running smoothly, so it's best to respect their role and approach them OOC.

==Tips and tools for roleplayers==

While being supported by Discworld MUD, roleplaying is not mandatory, meaning players are free to explore the game as they wish, whether through deep character immersion or a more gameplay focused style. While there are no rules or limits on the type of character you can create, it is recommended and preferred that you stay within the Discworld setting, following established Discworld lore. Many people choose to build their character's identity around their [[guild]] and [[starting location]]: a [[Djelibeybi|Djelian]] [[Pishe|Pishite]] character would likely speak and act differently than than a [[Ramtops]] [[Witch]].

The game offers numerous tools to facilitate character creation and enhance roleplayers' experiences. 

* [[Souls]]: These are built-in emotes that can express your character's feelings or actions in a variety of ways. For example, &lt;code>grin at pinkfish&lt;/code> or &lt;code>smile warmly&lt;/code>.
* [[Emote]]: A flexible command that allows you to describe your character's actions in any way you choose, offering a high degree of freedom for roleplaying scenarios.
* [[Say]]: This command lets you speak in your selected [[language]], being heard by everyone in the current room.
* [https://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/secure/boards.c?type=subject&amp;board=role-playing&amp;threaded=1 Role-playing board]: A [[bulletin board]] available on the web or in various locations, including The Patrician's Palace in [[Ankh-Morpork]], where you can post either [[roleplaying#In and out of character|in-character or out of character]] to find other roleplayers
* [[Clubs]]: There are various player-run clubs created to facilitate roleplay, such as the {{Club|guild_of_roleplayers|Guild of Roleplayers}}
* [[Writing a description|Describe]]: Used to write a description for your character, seen by others when they &lt;code>look&lt;/code> or &lt;code>peek&lt;/code> at you.
* [[Clothing]]: Thousands of items, both standard and customised, can be purchased across the Disc to help portray your character's style and identity.

===Roleplaying command===
{{see also|roleplaying (command)}}
The command &lt;code>roleplaying&lt;/code> is used to identify yourself as roleplaying, to locate others who may also be roleplaying as well as to change the MUD's gameplay output to a more immersive, descriptive style.

You can be informed of players marking themselves as roleplaying with &lt;code>inform roleplaying&lt;/code>.

===Roleplaying locations===
{{stub}}
Roleplay can happen anywhere two or more characters can interact, however certain areas of the MUD, from [[:Category:Eateries|eateries]] to [[club houses]] and [[player houses]], tend to attract roleplayers more than others. Some popular roleplaying spots include:

====Ankh-Morpork====
*[[The Mended Drum]]
*[[Ankh-Morpork Job Market|The Job Market]]

What is roleplaying?
     Roleplaying is when a person creates a persona for their game character and tries to faithfully portray that persona    
     with its strengths and weaknesses, virtues and foibles.  When playing Discworld in this way a roleplayer will likely act
     rather differently to someone who is treating the game as a competition.                                                

Conventions
     Roleplayers tend to divide their communication and actions into two categories.  In character (IC) and out of character 
     (OOC).  In character is when the player is roleplaying the character, out of character is when they're just chatting    
     with friends or need to discuss game mechanics.                                                                         

Supported, not required
     Unlike some other virtual worlds out there, you are not required to roleplay on Discworld.  However, if you are into    
     roleplaying, you will find there is a sizeable group of players on the mud for you to play with and Discworld tries to  
     support those who choose to roleplay and those who choose not to.                                                       
                                                                                                                             
     What kind of role you want to play is entirely up to you, although we do prefer you to stay in the setting of Discworld.
     (This is hardly a constraint; since this is such an eclectic place, it would be difficult to actually find a role that  
     would not fit with the possible exception of a Tolkien elf :)                                                           
                                                                                                                             
     Roleplayers on Discworld usually build their characters on guild identities.  Apart from that, they form their          
     characters with lots of humour and the numerous resources the mud has to offer: clothing, emotional expression,         
     character description, titles, the numerous ways of communication, etc.                                                 

Roleplaying mode
     To support the roleplaying community, you can enable roleplaying mode with the command "roleplaying immersive". When you
     put your character in this mode a number of commands work in a more in character manner.  For example "score" no longer 
     shows numbers but gives a textual description of your status. For example:                                              

     > score                                                                                                                      
     You are Ceres the Recruit in the Djelian Guard.                                                                              
     You are in perfect health and you are full of energy.                                                                        
     You should consider training your skills.                                                                                    
     You are evil and in the service of Pishe, the Goddess of Slight Showers.                                                     
     You will not flee.                                                                                                           
     You are unburdened and quite comfortable.                                                                                    
     You have an "arrangement" with Death.                                                                                        

     In addition many out of character commands (such as tell and remote souls) are disabled and others will be unable to use
     those commands on you.                                                                                                  

     If you would like to use the descriptive output for scores, skills and certain other commands, but not block remote     
     communication, then you can use "options output numbers {{=}} descriptive". If you would like to block remote communication
     but not receive descriptive output, then use the earmuff command.                                                       

Roleplaying board
     There is a roleplaying board in the Patrician's palace.  Please use it in a nice way, in character or out of character. 
     It might give you good ideas and also show you who else is interested in roleplaying.                                   

Roleplayers and non-roleplayers
     Please respect other players' style of playing, even if it is not yours.  Non-roleplayers may get a little confused with
     you.  In addition if you are not roleplaying please respect others who wish to roleplay.  Also remember that a          
     roleplayer who comes across as brusque or rude may simply be playing their role, it may not be personal!                

Creator interaction
     When dealing with creators, coders and liaisons alike, remember that they have a job to do and you should consider all  
     creator interaction as out of character.
