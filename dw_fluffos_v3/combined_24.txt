=== Content from Jewellery ===

Jewellery cannot be fixed in all [[Smithy]], check the locations in that page to see which ones allow fixing them.
*[[Mending_npcs#Jewellery|Mr Rendtnor]] can also restore jewellery for varying amounts of money.

(If your skill is not high enough, you can get a rough idea of the value by fencing something you know the value of like a $5 gold ring, then divide the result by the actual value and multiply by 100, to get your fencing return % - then fence the thing you don't know of, divide by your fencing return % then multiply by 100)

Jewellery can be turned into a [[blorple]] with [[Al'Hrahaz's Scintillating Blorpler]].

==Types==
There are various types of jewellery, and you're limited in the number of each type that you can wear.  If you can't put on an item of jewellery because you're wearing too many of that type already, it will tell you what's in the way of it.
