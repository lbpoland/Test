{{Mudlib caveat|scope=page|status=unconfirmed}}

It appears that more powerful [[attack messages]] appear when damage represents a greater percentage of the victim's total health. This is most obvious when comparing fights against very weak opponents (frogs, chickens, etc.) versus tough ones. As such, the numbers included below from the distribution mudlib are unlikely to be directly representative of current code but have been kept in the hope that they might be useful.

To complete the theme, a stylized skull picked out in red-tarnished iron grins morbidly from the middle of the backpack.  Silvery runes run through the black leather like quicksilver.
Octarine light pulses around it like an evil heartbeat.

 |items=Strip of cloth
}}

[[Bandage]] is a command which allows you to apply a bandage to yourself or another living thing in the same room.  If successful, the target will regenerate [[HP]] at an increased rate.

==Command details==
The bandage command requires 25 levels of [[crafts.medicine.firstaid]] to learn, and is usually taught by other players.

It can also be taught by [[Gennie Applebottom]] when someone is hurt in the room.

Each bandaging attempt costs 15 craft GP and requires a bandage (consumed).

Your bonus in [[crafts.medicine.firstaid]] not only determines the amount of HP regenerated, but the percentage of the target's total HP which is required for bandaging to be successful.  i.e. With a low bonus, you will only be able to bandage yourself/others who are slightly hurt, while someone with a high bonus can succeed on patients in bad shape.

The lower the target's percentage of HP, the harder it is to succeed - and the larger the chance of a TM.  As a rough guide, a 250 bonus allows bandaging at ~50% HP.

==Bandage details==
Bandaging uses '''strips of cloth''' which can be produced with the command &lt;code>tear&lt;/code> on clothing or other items made of cloth.
*Only strips made from certain types of cloth are suitable for use as bandages.
**The description of an appropriate strip of cloth will contain the line: "It is strong enough to bind even the nastiest flesh wounds."
**The materials suitable for bandages mentioned in &lt;code>help tear&lt;/code> are: '''cotton''', batiste, denim, organdy, terry cloth, broadcloth, dotted quirm, pique, twill, batik, corduroy, lawn, seersucker, voile, '''linen''', hessian, canvas, '''silk''' and hemp. 
**Clothes made from wool '''cannot''' be used as bandages.
**The exact material(s) an item is made of can be seen with the command [[appraise]].
*The size and condition of an item determines how many strips can be produced by tearing it - this is not skill-checked.
**The &lt;code>tear (item) test&lt;/code> command shows how many strips will be created without actually tearing the item.
**The size of an item determines the maximum number of strips that item can yield. This size is directly related to the size of the body parts that the items covers, see the [[coverage]] command.
**If the [[condition]] of the item is below perfect then the number of strips obtained is reduced. Note that even items in excellent condition might be a little bit damaged and possible to [[sew]] them.
** The combined weight of the strips produced will be equal to the item that you tore. This means that if an item is damaged, it will not only produce fewer strips, but each strip will also be heavier.
*Be careful not to tear something you want to keep as you cannot get the item back once it's in pieces!

When attempting to bandage a target, the bandage will be consumed whether the attempt succeeds or fails. 

If you keep your strips of cloth in a container [[identify]]ed as "medicine bag" or "component pouch" then they will be automatically used to bandage without having to take them out. To make this work, use the command "bandage target". The command "bandage target with bandage" will not work.

&lt;pre>Success message: You apply the bandage to yourself. You feel a stinging in your wounds.
Failure message: You attempt to apply a bandage but make a mess of it.  You throw away the ruined bandage in disgust.&lt;/pre>

==Skills used==
*[[crafts.medicine.firstaid]] (success and effectiveness of bandaging)
*[[covert.manipulation.sleight-of-hand]] (remaining hidden while bandaging)

Beat is a special attack where, if successful, the attacker beats aside the weapon of the victim. This does not do any damage, but instead costs the victim some action points, in the same way [[feint]], [[trip]], and [[shove]] do. It may also make the target easier to hit. The target must be holding a weapon in order to prepare this attack. Fighting.special.weapon is used to prepare and execute this attack, and fighting.melee.** is also used in the execution (confirmed by mock).

'''Behead''' is a [[:Category:Warrior commands|warrior-only command]] that is used mid combat and can decapitate the target provided that it lands the deathblow. Whether a weapon is capable of beheading can be found through use of the [[judge]] command.

[[Special:WhatLinksHere/Behead | Pages that link to this page]]: mostly weapons that this command can be used with.

This command allows you to prepare an attack with a weapon (which does [[Slice (command)|slicing]] or [[chop]]ping damage) against an opponent in combat.

__TOC__
{{-}}
==Acquisition==
Behead can be learned at 150 levels of [[fighting.special.weapon]] from a guild instructor or from another player who has the command.

== Syntax ==
 behead &lt;target> with &lt;weapon>
 behead &lt;target> &lt;carefully|calmly|roughly|savagely|brutally> with &lt;weapon>
 behead compare &lt;zone 1> with &lt;zone 2>

== Behead styles ==
Damage, preparation difficulty, launch difficulty and guild point cost will depend on the style used. From weakest to most damaging the target zones and associated guild point cost are:
 35gp (no style specified)
 35gp carefully
 35gp calmly
 35gp roughly
 40gp savagely
 45gp brutally
Generally the launch difficulty is constant and the preparation difficulty scales with damage.
==Behead messages==
If a beheading results in the death of the target, a special death message is displayed.

*The head of &lt;target> drops onto the ground like a ball.  Bounce, bounce, bounce.

*The head of &lt;target> falls heavily to the ground with a sickening crunch.  Now *that* would have given a headache, if it could still feel.

*The head of &lt;target> flies off the neck and hits you in the face, spraying blood all over your body.  Bath time!

*The head of &lt;target> is propelled from the body, which explodes like a nubile young person in bed with an experienced seamstress, gratuitously fountaining liquid over the area.  Anyone have a cigarette?

*The head of &lt;target> is thrown back, and to the left.  Back, and to the left.  Back... and to the left.

*The head of &lt;target> levitates for a moment as the torso flops to the ground, before rolling off to the right.

*The head of &lt;target> looks confused for a second, before falling to the ground.

*The head of &lt;target> quivers a bit as it remains in place, perched atop its owner's corpse for a moment, then slowly slides off.

*The head of &lt;target> sails through the air in a graceful arc before landing with a very soggy squishing sound.

*The head of &lt;target> slides off its owner's corpse, upends, and lands upside down, helping to keep some of the blood from spilling.

*The head of &lt;target> spins around several times before falling to the ground after slowing to a stop like a top losing energy.

*The head of &lt;target> stays in place seemingly untouched.  Only after the corpse falls to the ground does the head flop away from the torso.

*The head of &lt;target> whirls around several rotations on the neck before spinning off towards the ground, where it bounces a bit before coming to a rest.

*The head of &lt;target> falls to the ground and blood spurts in a magnificent fountain from where it used to be attached.

*The head of &lt;target> tips off to the left to hang by a small bit of flesh, before gravity has something to say about the matter and pulls it completely off the corpse, landing with a small bounce.

*The head of &lt;target> stays perched atop its owner's torso as it continues to fight, seemingly unaware that it died a few seconds ago.  Ah, now realisation has fully sunk in and the inanimate corpse tumbles quickly to the ground.

*The head of &lt;target> drops onto the ground and rolls head over, well, head for a bit before coming to a rest.

 | guild=[[Warriors Guild|Warriors]]
}}
'''Berserk''' is a [[Warrior]] only command which is used to attempt to enter a state of mind where the warrior will deal damage faster and pay no regard to damage done to them.

The berserking warrior can make more than twice as many attacks as normal (with sufficient skills) and receives a bonus to hit points and stats, but unfortunately cannot use most commands and will not defend against any attacks apart from specials. 

After berserking the warrior will be exhausted; unable to berserk again and subject to a stat penalty until they recover.

==Syntax==
 berserk

==Duration==
The duration (in seconds) is the number of guild points spent or the warrior's [[fighting.special.tactics]] bonus - whichever is less.

==Status effects==
Whilst beserking a warrior:
*has their tactics attitude set temporarily to insane;
*is no longer limited to two attacks per heartbeat, but each attack will cost 1 guild point each;
*receives +1 str, +1 dex and +1 con (conflicts with other stat bonuses such as iron gauntlets);
*receives +50% hp (on top of that gained from the bonus con);
*cannot defend against any attack apart from specials;
*cannot use fighting commands apart from warcry;
*cannot use covert commands apart from slip and palm;{{research}}
*cannot use rituals or spells from scrolls;
*cannot ride a horse (if berserk is initiated whilst mounted you will fall off).
*cannot use [[Endorphin's Floating Friend]]

=====Interaction with EFF=====

{{Prebox|Rouge Lachrymose moves aggressively towards the Imperial guard!

}}

==Recovery==
Normally after berserking you will be spiritually and physically exhausted:
*the physical exhaustion causes a stat loss of -1 or -2 to con, str and dex.  It lasts 2.5 minutes.
*the spiritual exhaustion prevents berserking again and lasts 2.5 times the duration of the Berserk.

The [[Restore]] ritual will remove the stat penalty, but you'll still have to wait to berserk again. The [[Soothe]] and [[Soothing Rain]] rituals will take you out of the berserker state with no such penalties, and will let you berserk again immediately.{{research}}

'''Bestow''' is a priest command used to put a ritual onto a [[Faith rods]] or item.  It can be learnt from your religious instructor at [[guild level]] 75.  Its cost and skill requirement varies depending on the ritual being bestowed and uses [[faith.items.scroll]] for creating [[wards]]

==Bestowing==
You will need deity points, the ritual, and the relevant faith skills to put a ritual on a rod or item.

You will need to find an empty "slot", and bestow the ritual into that slot.

You can only put one copy of each ritual into each rod, and when you bestow it you will attempt to perform it normally, but with a success resulting in that ritual becoming imbued.

Since bestowing costs DP it cannot be done by excommunicated priests.

The different types of rod have affinities that suit some ritual types more than others (see [[Faith rods]]).
It is much harder to bestow a ritual into a rod if it has a poor affinity for it.

==Bestowal Cost==
This list is gives the cost to &lt;code>bestow&lt;/code> a ritual after using [[Divine Guard]] or [[Divine Sentinel]].

Bestowing rituals on a best affinity baton costs as much gp as the ritual's base cost.

Note: the GP cost for bestowing a faith rod or performing a ritual is affected by environment modifiers. Bestowing a ward is not affected. When testing for the performance cost, please do so with neutral modifiers.

=== Content from Brief ===

Setting something to '''brief''' mode will cause you not to see some aspects of it.  Its opposite is verbose mode--seeing everything fully--which is the default.

 Forms of syntax available for the command 'brief':
 brief 
 brief &lt;type>
 brief all

"Brief" by itself will tell you which things you have in brief mode and which you have in verbose mode. "Brief &lt;type>" puts the specified in brief mode, while "brief all" puts everything in brief mode.  "Verbose" is used in the same way.

==Things that can be put in brief mode==

===Combat===
If combat is in brief mode, you don't see attacks that don't land, or that are fully absorbed by [[armour]] or [[:Category:Arcane shielding|arcane shielding]].

You do still see attacks that successfully deal damage, your monitor, people moving aggressively towards you, and [[TPA]] breaking.

===Look===
Using brief look makes it so that when you move, you automatically "glance" instead of automatically "look"ing--in other words, the full room description is suppressed and you only see the brief description.  You can still "look" to see the full room description.

===Score===
If score is in brief mode, then "score" by itself will be the same as "score brief", showing only (as the default) current and maximum [[hit points]], current and maximum [[guild points]], current [[xp]], and current [[burden]].

Also, in this mode, "score stats" is shown in a slightly compressed form.

You can use "score brief" or "score verbose" to use the score command in brief or verbose mode once.

===Names===
With names in brief mode, you won't see people's pre-titles (titles set with the [[title]] command) when you see them do things, or when you see them in a room.

===Htell===
Having htell in brief mode suppresses the timestamps that normally precede each tell in the tell history.

===Finger===
&lt;!--I am not convinced this does anything at all; it looks the same both ways to me.  Perhaps it controls something other than what you see when you "finger" someone?-->
This does not seem to change if choose verbose or brief

===Errors===
&lt;!--Something to do with runtime error messages?-->
{{research}}

===Quit===
Setting quit to brief mode stops you from getting the "Greco the Departure Gecko starts inspecting all your items and scribbling on a notepad" message when you quit.

You can use "quit brief" or "quit verbose" to use the quit command in brief or verbose mode once.

===Temperature===
Setting temperature to brief suppresses mention of items that are having "little or no effect" when you use the [[temperature]] command.

You can also "temperature very brief" to see only the room temperature, overall warmth or cooling your clothing provides, and your personal temperature and whether you're getting warmer or cooler; "temperature brief" to see all that ''and'' the specific items of clothing that are having an effect on your temperature; or "temperature verbose" to see all that ''and'' the items of clothing that are having little or no effect.

===Money===
In brief mode, the "money" command outputs the contents of your purse as a sort of abbreviated summary instead of listing every type of coin individually.  For example, instead of seeing:
{{Prebox|Your purse contains 3 Ankh-Morpork royals, 6 Ankh-Morpork ten-dollars, 7 Ankh-Morpork dollars, one Ankh-Morpork half-dollar, 4 Ankh-Morpork ten-pence, 5 Ankh-Morpork pence, 4 Agatean Empire rhinu, 5 Djelian talents, 4 Djelian tooni, 31 Djelian talona, 40 Djelian ptascpi, 62 Genuan livres and 50 Genuan cents.}}
You'll see this:
 Your purse contains A$367.95, 4Rh, DjToon 57.50 and 6,2,50Gf.

You can use "money brief" or "money verbose" to use the money command in brief or verbose mode once.

===Count===
In brief mode, the "count" command will only tell you how many things you've counted instead of listing them all.

You can use "count brief" or "count verbose" to use the count command in brief or verbose mode once.

===Errorreply===
Using brief here causes you to get informed of bug/typo/idea replies like this:

 You have a new bug reply from &lt;creator>.

instead of like this:
{{Prebox|A hairy report insect scuttles in with a cloud of legs.
The hairy report insect whispers to you: You have a new bug reply from &lt;creator>.
&lt;br>The hairy report insect scuttles about insectly.
&lt;br>The hairy report insect says: Ah, home again.
&lt;br>The hairy report insect disappears under the floor boards.}}

(The verbose version is also visible to others in the room.)

===Purse===
Putting your purse in brief mode causes you to see only, "Your purse is closed" when you use the "inventory" command, instead of seeing how much money you have.

===Time===
In brief mode, the "time" command will only show the time in one location--your time zone, if you've set it, or London if you haven't--instead of in several different time zones.

You can use "time brief" or "time verbose" to use the time command in brief or verbose mode once.

===Tell===
&lt;!--Doesn't seem to do anything?-->
{{research}}

===Ignore===
In brief mode, "ignore" gives you a list of people you're ignoring, in sentence form ("You are ignoring womble and frog."), and suppresses the reason and amount of time.

In verbose mode, "ignore" puts every person you're ignoring on a separate line, and shows the reason (or that you didn't specify a reason) and how much longer you'll be ignoring them for (if applicable).

You can use "ignore brief" or "ignore verbose" to use the ignore command in brief or verbose mode once.

===Exits===
With exits in brief mode, exits will appear in their glance/brief look form, independent of whether you're looking or glancing.

(This does not affect the "exits" command.)

===Gp===
In brief mode, the "gp" command shows you how many of each type of gp you have as a nicely formatted list. If you don't have enough gp for a certain kind of command, it will show up as a negative number--how many more gp you need before you'll be able to use gp for those kinds of commands.

In verbose mode, the "gp" command gives the same information, but in full sentences.  Also, instead of showing how much more gp you need to start using gp for certain kinds of commands, it shows you the threshhold itself.

===Syntax===
In brief mode, the "syntax" command simply lists the available syntaxes for the specified command.  In verbose mode, it also gives an explanation for each syntax.

You can use "syntax &lt;verb> {brief|verbose}" to use the syntax command in brief or verbose mode once.

=== Content from Burden ===
A player's '''burden''' is a measure of how much difficulty they are having carrying things and moving around due to the encumbrance of their inventory.

==Burden calculation==
Your burden is calculated as follows:
*Add up the weight of all items in your possession, in all your containers.
**Worn items count as half their weight.
**Items held in one hand count as twice their weight.
**Items held in two hands count as 1.5x their weight.
**Shields still count as 1x their weight when held.
*Determine your maximum carrying capacity as:

{{Prebox|Maximum carrying capacity (lb) {{=}} 1.89 * (20 + [[strength]] + [[strength]]&lt;sup>2&lt;/sup>/5)}}
This gives:
:*8 strength: 77.112 lb
:*9 strength: 85.428 lb
:*10 strength: 94.5 lb
:*11 strength: 104.328 lb
:*12 strength: 114.912 lb
:*13 strength: 126.252 lb
:*14 strength: 138.348 lb
:*15 strength: 151.2 lb
:*16 strength: 164.808 lb
:*17 strength: 179.172 lb
:*18 strength: 194.292 lb
:*19 strength: 210.168 lb
:*20 strength: 226.8 lb
:*21 strength: 244.188 lb
:*22 strength: 262.332 lb
:*23 strength: 281.232 lb
:*24 strength: 300.888 lb
:*25 strength: 321.3 lb

*Divide the first by the second to get your burden level.

==Effects of burden==
Burden has the following effects:

===Dexterity penalties===
*50-74% burden results in a -1 dex penalty.
*74-99% burden results in a -2 dex penalty.
*100-124% burden results in a -3 dex penalty.
And so on. It's possible to get up to 200% burden by holding a box containing exactly your maximum burden's worth of weight in it, or (very temporarily) to 400% and higher by wearing very heavy custom armour and then taking severe strength penalties.

===Picking up and dropping things===
*Your carrying capacity is separate from your burden. 
*Since wearing things halves their effect on your burden and holding things doubles it, the point where you're maxed out and can't pick up any more can be anywhere from 50% to 200% depending on how much of your stuff is worn or held.
*You can only take something out or put something into bags and other containers that you're carrying if you've got enough "space" to carry another of it.
*If your carried weight changes such that it exceeds 100% of max (for example, due to a loss of [[strength]]), then you will automatically drop items to reduce it below 100% again.

===Combat efficiency===
*Burden negatively affects one's 'to-hit' chance with all weapons.
*If fighting unarmed, then there is an additional 'to-hit' penalty from burden.
*Burden negatively affects one's ability to successfully [[parry]] or [[dodge]] an incoming attack.
*An additional penalty to [[dodge|dodging]] occurs if your burden is over twice your [[dexterity]] stat.
*Burden increases the [[action points|action point]] cost of [[dodge|dodging]].

===Buoyancy===
The more burden a player has, the more trouble they will have staying afloat while [[swimming]].  This can be counteracted somewhat by effects that increase a player's buoyancy, such as being a [[witch]] or wearing an [[Granny Lipintense's Layer of Lard|aquamarine magick crystal]] or [[swim ring]].

=== Content from Burial_commands ===
 |gp=50 per corpse
 |learntat=guild level 25
 |skills=[[faith.rituals.special]], [[faith.rituals.offensive.area]]
 |guild=[[Priests]]}}

'''Burial commands''' are [[priest]]-only commands used to bury a [[corpse]] or corpses, sacrificing it to your [[:Category:Worshippable_gods|deity]] at the same time.  This is also known as ritual burial or ritburying.  

==Aquisition==
The command is learned at [[guild level]] 25 from your religious instructor.

==Different versions==
The specific command you get depends on your deity.  While the visual effect is different for each, they all work the same way.  The six versions are:
*Decompose ([[Gufnork]])
*Ensumpf ([[Sek]])
*Envalise ([[Hat]])
*Pyroscipate ([[Fish]]) (Has a different appearance depending on whether the burial takes place on land or in the water.)
*Shroud ([[Gapp]])
*Ventisepelate ([[Pishe]] and [[Sandelfon]]) (Has a different appearance depending on whether the burial takes place indoors or outdoors.)

==Details==
You can attempt to ritually bury as many corpses at once as you have [[gp]] for.  However, it's more difficult the more corpses you try to bury at once, and it takes longer.  Having higher [[faith.rituals.special]] seems to help on both counts.  If you fail to ritually bury a corpse, you can't try again.  You can, however, bury the corpse normally and still get the burial [[xp]].

Unlike regular burial, you can use ritual burial in combat.  This uses [[faith.rituals.offensive.area]] in some manner (it's possible to tm the skill this way).  For [[Sek]]kite priests, ritual burial in combat is faster and ritual burial combat out of combat is significantly slower.

Note that you cannot ritual bury a corpse after it has already been buried using the 'bury' command. It IS possible to recover a ritually buried corpse despite it being apparently 'destroyed' by the ritual.

Ritual burial adds five [[deity points]] to the pool per corpse, making it as efficient as [[pray]]ing away from a high altar.

==Achievements==
There are three achievements in the Priests category related to this command:
*{{Achievement|Dearly Departed}} (Minor)
*{{Achievement|Last Rites}} (Moderate)
*{{Achievement|Shepherd Of The Soul}} (Large)

[[Category:Guild commands]]
[[Category:Faith commands]]
[[Category:Priest commands]]

=== Content from Bury ===

You can "recover" the item if it has not yet disappeared.

You can bury up to twenty items at a time.

==Syntax==
&lt;pre>bury
bury &lt;object>
bury &lt;object> in me&lt;/pre>

The first syntax, "bury" by itself, will bury the first corpse on the ground, or all corpses on the ground.

The second syntax will bury the specified object or objects on the ground.

The third syntax will bury the specified object or objects in your inventory.

==Effects==
Burying things has the following effects:
*Burying the [[corpse]] of something you were in combat with when it died will give you (and everyone else it was in combat with) some [[xp]]--this is nearly always more than the xp you get from killing it in the first place.  This only happens the first time you bury a corpse, and it only happens if it's been less than five minutes since the npc died.
*Burying a corpse for the first time will give you 10 [[gp]] per corpse.
*In certain rooms--notably on bridges, and on the wall surrounding [[Djelibeybi]]--burying something will not put it underground, where it can be recovered, but will rather put it in the room below.  However, corpses shoved over the edge of the [[Djelibeybi]] wall this way will be automatically buried very soon after they hit the ground.
*If you bury an item in a [[Divine Hand|passage room]] and then exit without recovering it, the item will be lost forever. Similarly, if you bury items in a crystal sphere created from [[Stasis]], [[Great Stasis]], or [[Holy Sanctuary]] and exit without recovering them, they'll be lost forever.
*If you bury an item in a [[Carriages]] or on a [[Ferries|ferry]] you instead throw them out of the transport and the item becomes unrecoverable and lost forever.
*If you bury an item while standing on the [[Lancre]] bridge, the items fall into the Lancre Gorge.
*Items that are buried will disappear after a time, becoming unrecoverable.  The exact amount of time [[Research:Bury|might depend on the room.]]

[[Burial commands|Ritually burying]] a corpse has much the same effect as burying it, except that it costs 50 gp per corpse, no gp is received back, and it gives command xp in addition to normal burial xp.

==Recovering items==
To get back an item which has been buried, you "recover" it.  You may also recover an item inside another item.  You can recover up to twenty objects at a time.

If the item is light enough, it will end up in your inventory.  If it's too heavy for you to carry, it will end up on the ground.

&lt;pre>recover &lt;buried object> 
recover &lt;thing> in &lt;buried object>
&lt;/pre>

You can also recover a corpse part from a corpse, cutting it off in the process.  For example:
&lt;pre>recover heart in corpse
You recover the bird heart.&lt;/pre>
You need to be holding a suitable sharp weapon for this usage.

''This method can be used to recover [[Grflx scale|Grflx Hide]] from the [[Grflxen |Grflx Queen]] which can then be dragged away, even when players are unable to get it normally!''

==Exceptions==
You can't bury things under the following circumstances:
*If you're inside of some type of [[real estate]].
*If you're in a [[water room]] and not at the bottom.
*If it's too [[bright|dark]] to see.
*If the thing you're trying to bury is a player corpse that is not your own.
*If you are in combat.

=== Content from Calendar ===
The '''calendar''' command shows you what day it is on Discworld, and can also show you when a particular Discworld date is. Used with no arguments, it shows you the dates that will appear over the next seven real-world days.

==Using the command==
There are several available syntaxes:
 calendar 
 calendar [the] &lt;day> [of] &lt;month> {Prime|prime|Secundus|secundus|1|2} &lt;year> 
 calendar &lt;month> {Prime|prime|Secundus|secundus|1|2} [the] &lt;day> &lt;year> 
 calendar [the] &lt;day> [of] &lt;month> {Prime|prime|Secundus|secundus|1|2} 
 calendar &lt;month> {Prime|prime|Secundus|secundus|1|2} [the] &lt;day> 
 calendar &lt;start> &lt;finish> 
 calendar &lt;special day> &lt;year> 
 calendar &lt;days> 
 calendar today 
 calendar &lt;special day>

The first option shows the Discworld dates that will appear over the next seven real-world days, and when.

The next four options show when a specified Discworld date will begin and end.

The sixth option shows the Discworld dates that will appear over the next ''n'' days, where ''n'' is a number you specify:
 > calendar 2
 Wed Aug  5 2009: Monday 21st Grune Prime, UC 2026.
      [06:00]    Tuesday 22nd Grune Prime, UC 2026.
      [13:12]    Wednesday 23rd Grune Prime, UC 2026.
      [20:24]    Thursday 24th Grune Prime, UC 2026.
 Thu Aug  6 2009:
      [03:36]    Friday 25th Grune Prime, UC 2026.
      [10:48]    Saturday 26th Grune Prime, UC 2026.
      [18:00]    Sunday 27th Grune Prime, UC 2026.

The seventh and tenth options show when a specified special day will begin and end.

The eighth option shows the Discworld dates that will appear between a certain number of days from now, &lt;start>, and a certain number of days from now, &lt;finish>:
 > calendar 2 3
 Fri Aug  7 2009: Sunday 27th Grune Prime, UC 2026.
      [01:12]    Octeday 28th Grune Prime, UC 2026.
      [08:24]    Monday 29th Grune Prime, UC 2026.
      [15:36]    Tuesday 30th Grune Prime, UC 2026.
      [22:48]    Wednesday 31st Grune Prime, UC 2026.
 Sat Aug  8 2009:
      [06:00]    Thursday 1st August Prime, UC 2026.
      [13:12]    Friday 2nd August Prime, UC 2026.
      [20:24]    Saturday 3rd August Prime, UC 2026.

The ninth option shows the Discworld dates for today.

==The months==
There are thirteen Discworld months per Discworld half-year or "common year" (400 Discworld days):
* Offle (32 days)
* February (32 days)
* March (32 days)
* April (32 days)
* May (32 days)
* June (32 days)
* Grune (32 days)
* August (32 days)
* Spune (32 days)
* Sektober (32 days)
* Ember (32 days)
* December (32 days)
* Ick (16 days)

Each of these months occurs twice per Discworld calendar year or "astronomical year" (800 Discworld days), suffixed with "Prime" for the first occurrence or "Secundus" for the second occurrence.

==The seasons==
There are eight main seasons on the Disc:
* Spring Prime: lasts from at least 21st February Prime to 23rd May Prime
* Summer Prime: lasts from 24th May Prime to 27th August Prime
* Autumn Prime: lasts from 28th August Prime to 28th Ember Prime
* Spindlewinter: lasts from at least 32nd Ember Prime to 19th February Secundus
* Secundus Spring: lasts from 20th February Secundus to at least ...
* Secundus Summer: lasts from at least 5th June Secundus to 19th August Secundus
* Secundus Autumn: lasts from at least 30th August Secundus to 30th Ember Secundus
* Backspindlewinter: lasts from at least 2nd December Secundus to 18th February Prime

In and around [[Djelibeybi]], the seasons are given different names:
* Seedtime: corresponds to the winters and springs
* Inundation: corresponds to the summers
* Sog: corresponds to the autumns

Seasons can affect the following:
*The [[weather]] and [[temperature]] in outdoor rooms
*Room descriptions of many outdoor rooms
*Whether certain things can be [[gather]]ed (although most gatherable herbs and spices are available year-round in the herb gardens they're found in, other items like melons, garlic, and chestnuts are seasonal)

==Special days==
&lt;!--I'm not actually sure which of these are really active... I know there are some that aren't listed, like Beard Day, Cabbage Day, International Women's Day, but I'm not sure when those are.-->
&lt;!--These might change each year if they coincide with roundworld day. Soul cake days come from the AM Daily edition 58 article 4, as the revised dates for roundworld days. -->
The Discworld has a number of special days listed on the calendar:
* Hogswatchday - 1st Offle Prime
* Crueltideday - 1st Offle Secundus
* Small Gods Day - 24th June Prime
* Alls Fallow - 24th June Secondus
* Soul Cake Tuesday - 23rd August
* Soul Cake Days - The first Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday after the first half-moon in Sektober
* Sektober Fools' Day - 1st Sektober

There are also some special days that aren't on the Discworld calendar, and which are celebrated according to their roundworld dates:
* Cream Pie Day - January 11th
* Valentine's Day - February 14th
* [[Cabbage]] Day - February 17th
* International Women's Day - March 8th
* Ukulele Day - August 23rd
* Beard Day - September 10th
* Talk Like a Pirate Day - September 19th
* [[Greco]]'s [[Gumboot|day off]] - October 30th and 31st
* Pink Bow Day - November 10th
