==Money types==

The value for each coins for the various currencies vary wildly, but they can all be expressed in a base value of 1 wichit bead (wibi) or 1 brass coin.

There are several types of '''currency''' that can be found on the Disc that are legal tender somewhere (as reported by 'money here') and/or have coins that can be obtained.
*Newbie Area or [[Pumpkin Town]] money, in use in the newbie area. (It is converted to local currency upon leaving Pumpkin Town.) It is also the currency in the [[Newbie Area Museum]], but only outside the shop, with no coins in sight.
*[[Counterweight Continent]], [[Agatean Empire]] or BP money, in use in [[Bes Pelargic]], on [[Thursday's Island]] and on the [[Brown Islands]], although you need to trade with the natives as they do not accept money.
*Ankh-Morpork or AM money, in use in [[Ankh-Morpork]] and the rest of the [[Sto Plains]].
*Djelian or DJB money, in use in [[Djelibeybi]], the [[Djelibeybi Harbour]], the shop of the [[Imtebos farmstead]], the [[Lower Djel Trading Post]], and the [[Klatchian Foreign Legion]] outpost.
*Ephebian money, in use in [[Ephebe]], the [[Chronides farmstead]], [[Il Drim]], the [[Oasis]] and [[Calh-Nhad]].  Also may be found on mean Ephebian mercenaries in Ankh-Morpork and spectators and fans in the [[PK combat arena]].
*Genuan money, in use in [[Genua]] and [[Bois]].
*Lancre money, in use in the [[Ramtops]] and [[Uberwald]].
*Klatchian money, in use in the ruins of [[Tacticum]].
*Tsortean money, in use in the [[PK combat arena]] ([[Throw-Myself-To-The-Lions Dublar]] has coins).
*Howondaland money, available from the [[money changer]] south of the Dockside Market, [[Ephebe]].

Other types of '''currency''' are coded and can be simulated using the ''rate'' command, but coins for them have not yet been found in game. (If you find a way to get coins from those currencies please update!) The full names of many of the denominations are unknown. It is possible that extra coins exist for each currency (as Ankh-Morpork pence come in pence, ten-pence, and half-dollars while still being referred to as #p by the rate command). As these currencies are currently unobtainable, it is impossible to find the missing coins. 
*Chee Smee Blee money.
*Count von Mont money.
*Troll money.
*Gemstone money.
*Ham-on-koom money.
*Krullian money.
*Zchlotia money.

Finally, there is a currency which used to be in game but should not be anymore:
*Provincial, which has been replaced with the other currencies.

The [[Currency/Big Table of Coins|Big Table of Coins]] is a simplified, sortable table with the value of every coin currently in circulation. More detailed information on each currency is listed below.

==Converting money==

In-game, you can use the "rate" command or the "convert" command to see how much a certain amount is worth in another type of currency.

&lt;pre>rate &lt;money> {in|from} &lt;place> {to|in} &lt;place>
rate &lt;money> {to|in} &lt;place>&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>convert money &lt;money> {in|from} &lt;place> {to|in} &lt;place>
convert money &lt;money> {to|in} &lt;place>&lt;/pre>

For example:
&lt;pre>>rate LSov 2|8|-|1/4 to am
LSov 2|8|-|1/4 is worth A$138.24.
>rate 27 Lancre crowns, 56 Lancre shillings, 4 Lancre sixpences, 4 Lancre thruppences, 4 Lancre tuppences, one Lancre penny, 5 Lancre ha'pennies and 3 Lancre farthings to am
LSov 2|7|11|8 3/4 is worth A$138.14.&lt;/pre>

You can use a [[money changer]] to actually change one type of currency to another, or use [[bank]]s that have branches in different areas.

Tsortean money is unique in that there are two different categories of coins - the coins of the para category (coloured blue) are all multiples of 3, and the coins of the akche category (coloured red) are all multiples of 7. The one coin that falls into both categories is the heptakche.

[[Category:Concepts]]

=== Content from Follow ===

Unlike [[pursue]], there is no skillcheck to continue following someone, and if they use [[Divine Hand]] or [[Visit]] you will go with them.  However, you can't follow a witch on a [[broomstick]], and if an exit is restricted (as with worshipper-only areas of temples) you can be left behind: following doesn't bypass the restriction.  Similarly, if an exit is skillchecked (as with climb exits and swimming) it's possible to fail the skillcheck and be left behind.

The "unfollow" command stops you following someone, and the "lose" command stops someone following you.

==Groups and following==
If you're in a [[group]], you'll automatically follow the group leader.  You can also use "group follow &lt;member(s)>" (or "group follow all") to follow other group members, and "group unfollow &lt;member(s)>" to stop following them.

==NPCs and following==
Typically, [[minions]] will automatically follow you--and you may automatically follow ''them'' upon summoning them.  [[Pet]]s, too, usually follow you, although they may get left behind if you use [[Divine Hand]].

Most other npcs will not accept follow requests; you'll have to use [[pursue]] or just manually go through the exits you see them go through.  One exception is [[Khepresh]] of [[Hat]], who will let you follow him and who periodically uses [[Visit]].  Another exception is the npc you must escort in [[Agatean family]] missions.

[[Category:Commands]]

=== Content from Idle ===

Sending anything to the MUD, even a failed command or a blank line, resets your idle time.

==Command==
&lt;pre>idle &lt;player>&lt;/pre>

The command just tells you how long a single player has been idle.

==Effects of being idle==
If you are two minutes or more idle, anyone sending you a [[tell]] will get a message that you are idle, and for how long (although the tell is still sent).  Also, if someone uses [[who]] or whois on you, it will say how long you have been idle.

If you are five minutes or more idle, there are more significant effects.
*You will stop getting shared xp from [[group]]mates, and you will stop assisting in fights if you are on group assist.
*You will not be able to automatically [[teach]] people, even if you have auto-teach enabled.
*If you have anything in your [[queue]], it will be cleared when you reach five minutes idle.

Finally, regular players will be logged out automatically when they have been idle for thirty minutes([[Creator]]s can be idle for longer before being logged out).  This is called idling out, and has a special message associated with it.  

What others see:
&lt;pre>Player has been idle for too long; she vanishes in a puff of boredom.&lt;/pre>
What you see:
&lt;pre>You idled out, sorry.&lt;/pre>

=== Content from Introduction_to_commands ===
{{tocleft}}
This is a sorted list of basic commands (in '''bold''') a new player will find useful, as well as brief explanations of what they do.

Most commands on Discworld are entered using a simple, verb-noun format: examples are "look at man" or "get pamphlet". In many cases, you can simply type what it is you wish to do, in the simplest terms.

The &lt; and > symbols are not entered to the MUD, but rather indicate a modifier to the command. Thus, '''consider &lt;target>''' would be entered as '''consider man'''.

Movement is governed through the entry of directions, rather than commands, and is covered at the end of this section. 

==General commands==

'''consider &lt;target/all>'''
This command will give you a rough idea of how tough another living creature is, relative to yourself. Note that this command only takes physical things- weapons, armour, hit points, and so on- into account. A Witch will usually seem much weaker than a Warrior, according to the consider command, but will usually have spells memorized to even the odds.

'''health &lt;target/all>'''
Will give you an idea of how healthy a target is. The information given is relative; for example, a healthy creature will be "in good shape" while one "in very bad shape" is on the brink of death.

'''look''' / '''look &lt;thing>'''
This command, as one might expect, will cause the player to look around, or look at something specific. The related command, '''glance''', may be used in a similar fashion but will result in a much briefer description.

==Inventory-Related Commands==
'''draw &lt;item>''' / '''sheathe &lt;item>'''
These command will draw (or sheathe) a weapon from (or into) a scabbard.

'''get &lt;thing>''' or '''get &lt;thing> from &lt;thing>'''
Will attempt to pick up and carry item, or move an item from a container (such as a [[backpack]]) into the player's main inventory.

'''hold &lt;thing>''' / '''unhold &lt;thing>'''
These commands will hold and unhold items you are carrying. This command is commonly used to wield weapons, tools, and similar items.

'''look''' / '''look &lt;thing>'''
This command, as one might expect, will cause the player to look around, or look at something specific. The related command, '''glance''', may be used in a similar fashion but will result in a much briefer description.

'''put &lt;thing> in/on &lt;thing>'''
Will attempt to place an item in or on an object.

'''wear &lt;item>''' / '''remove &lt;item>'''
This command will cause you to attempt to wear or remove an item, usually a garment, armour, or jewellery.

==Movement Commands==
'''north''' or '''n'''
Will attempt to move the player north one room.

'''south''' or '''s'''
Will attempt to move the player southone room.

'''east''' or '''e'''
Will attempt to move the player east one room.

'''west''' or '''w'''
Will attempt to move the player west one room.

'''northeast''' or '''ne'''
Will attempt to move the player northeast one room.

'''northwest''' or '''nw'''
Will attempt to move the player northwest one room.

'''southeast''' or '''se'''
Will attempt to move the player southeast one room.

'''southwest''' or '''sw'''
Will attempt to move the player north southwest room.

'''up''' or '''u'''
Will attempt to move the player up stairs. 

'''down''' or '''d'''
Will attempt to move the player down stairs.

=== Content from Introduction_to_settings ===
The following settings are likely to be helpful to a new character. Command text is in '''bold'''; explanations are in normal text.



'''monitor on'''&lt;br>
This setting will enable your [[Monitor]] in combat. The Monitor is a helpful little string of text that contains such vital information as your [[Hit Points]], [[Guild Points]], total [[Experience]] and [[Burden]]. It reappears every [[heartbeat]] during combat.

The same information can be viewed by typing '''score brief'''.


'''options output map look=left''' and '''options output map lookcity=left''' &lt;br>
These settings, when used together, will allow you to view the in-game map. This tool is invaluable for speedy navigation, and when combined with a player [[Atlas]], makes it very easy to find your way through the Discworld.  If you have brief look on, then the syntaxes are '''options output map glance=left''' and '''options output map glancecity=left'''.


'''term ansi'''&lt;br>
This command allows your terminal to display certain text in colour. This is great, as it allows the player to quickly differentiate between different types of information. For example, a room description may be in white, while the weather information will appear in yellow and the exits in green. 


'''wimpy 30'''&lt;br>
This will set your [[wimpy]] to 30%, the maximum allowed by the game. The effect is simple- when your hit points drop below 30% of maximum, you will attempt to flee the room via the same direction you entered.

=== Content from IPv6 ===

Using IPv6 might help with connections problems with the line through which the IPv4 connections go through. It can help with disconnection issues that only affect IPv4.

To get IPv6 to work for your mudding pleasure you need:
*an '''IPv6 tunnel broker''' or an IPv6 enabled internet connection
*an '''IPv6 enabled client''' or a suitable IPv4 to IPv6 proxy
*and to use the '''IPv6 address for Discworld Mud'''.

==Discworld IPv6 address==
To mud using IPv6 you need to use the IPv6 address for the mud:
:&lt;big>'''discworld.starturtle.net'''&lt;/big> or by IP address ['''2a02:8010:6224:2::69'''] port 4242.
*The above address should try to connect you through IPv6 and if that fails through IPv4.
*The line after you enter your password will tell you "and are currently logged in from &lt;address>". If this starts with "::ffff:" then you are still using IPv4. (Note: You can also use the command 'access ip' on the mud to check the IP address the mud is seeing.)

Warning: Not all mud clients support IPv6!

==IPv6 Tunnel Brokers==
&lt;onlyinclude>There are several so called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IPv6_tunnel_brokers IPv6 brokers] that can allow one to access the IPv6 network without having an IPv6 enabled internet connection. Some are free. Some require registration.&lt;/onlyinclude>

Obviously you don't need this if your internet connection already provides IPv6.


;Be advised that that the connections from the IPv6 tunnel might not be protected like your regular connection by your firewall, some adjustments might be necessary. The tunnel might be exposing all the ports on your computer, bypassing any router protections.
*On GNU/Linux you need to use ip6tables for IPv6 and iptables for IPv4.
*You can test one port on an IPv6 address [https://www.subnetonline.com/pages/ipv6-network-tools/online-ipv6-port-scanner.php here]. Use your IPv6 address from the previous link.


For more information, a series of blog posts on IPv6 might explain things better:

For Gentoo, the [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/IPv6_router_guide?style=printable Gentoo IPv6 Router Guide] provides information to get IPv6 working and lists a few tunnel brokers.

===Miredo/Teredo/Toredo===
[https://www.remlab.net/miredo/ Miredo] offers quick-n-easy IPV6 connectivity for GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and Mac OS X. It is free.

Toredo is the implementation bundled in Windows Vista and Windows XP SP2.


Sojan suggested this link on the boards:
*https://ipv6int.net/systems/windows_xp-ipv6.html


See also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_tunneling Wikipedia's article on Teredo Tunneling]


For '''Gentoo''' you can "emerge miredo". Then, "/etc/init.d/miredo start". If you want the service to start at each boot, do "rc-update add miredo defaut".


For '''Windows''', it seems you need Toredo support (see the [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb457011(v=technet.10) Microsoft Toredo overview]).
*On Windows XP this apparently requires installing Service Pack 2. Following the instructions in  [https://ipv6int.net/systems/windows_xp-ipv6.html Sojan's second link] it is sufficient to run the command "netsh interface ipv6 install" and then enable Microsoft TCP/IP Version 6 in the properties of the network connection you want to use. At this point you should have an IPv6 address {{research}}, even though it won't show up in the output of the "ipconfig" command until the command "netsh interface ipv6 set privacy disabled" is executed as well.
*You can set the Teredo server you use with "netsh interface ipv6 set teredo client teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com" by replacing the default server by another one like those in the list below.
*On Windows Vista it should work out-of-the-box.
*It is not very clear if anything needs to be done next. If it doesn't "just work" then Toredo probably needs to be activated and/or configured to use public servers.


A list of (hopefully working) public Teredo servers:
* teredo.remlab.net / teredo-debian.remlab.net / teredo2.remlab.net (France)
* teredo.autotrans.consulintel.com (Spain)
* teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com (USA, Redmond) (default for WindowsXP/2003/Vista/2008 OS)
* teredo.ngix.ne.kr (South Korea)
* teredo.managemydedi.com (USA, Chicago)
* teredo.trex.fi (Finland)
* teredo.ginzado.ne.jp (Japan)
* teredo.iks-jena.de (Germany)
* debian-miredo.progsoc.org

===SixXS/AICCU===
[https://www.sixxs.net/ SixXS] provides a client, '''AICCU''', which is available for Windows, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and many other platforms.

&lt;big>{{Fontcolor|red|It seems that AICCU only works after registering, it cannot be used anonymously.}}&lt;/big>

See the [https://www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu/ AICCU download page].

For '''Gentoo''' you only need to "emerge aiccu". Then you need to configure the file "/etc/aiccu.conf" with your account information. Then you can "/etc/init.d/aiccu start" to get it to work. If you want the service to start at each boot, do "rc-update add aiccu defaut".

For '''Mac OS X''', you can download it from MacPorts or as a Mac OS X binary but then you need to do some more things. See the [https://www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu/ AICCU download page].

For '''Windows''', There is a graphical user interface (GUI) on the [https://www.sixxs.net/tools/aiccu/ AICCU download page].

==Testing IPv6==
*A simple test is to try to visit https://www.ipv6.sixxs.net/, if it works then it means IPv6 works for you.
*You can also use a javascript test https://test-ipv6.com/ to check if it works.
*Or https://test-ipv6.com/simple_test.html


On a GNU/Linux system, you can try to connect with telnet on the console:
{{Prebox|
$ telnet 2a01:348:19e:2::2 4242
}}

==IPv6 enabled Mud Clients==
Not all mud clients work with IPv6. See the [[MUD client]] page for links.

Here are some that work:

Windows
*Kildclient, but the devs didn't test it
*Mudlet
*TinTin++
*TinyFugue

GNU/Linux
*Kildclient, but the devs didn't test it
*Kmuddy
*Mudlet
*TinTin++
*TinyFugue

Detailed instructions:

===Kildclient===
Information by Aphaea

Export your settings from the Discworld world, create a new world using the IPv6 address as host and 4242 as port, import your exported settings to it and connect.

===Mudlet===
Information by Xorphitus:

To be helpful for once, I can tell you how I connect to the Disc with a client as well. I use ''Mudlet'' which can be downloaded for free [https://www.mudlet.org/download/ here].
*You have to activate or turn on ipv6 first of all, and hope your network and your computer support it somehow first of all. Check some lines above how to do or check that.
*Install Mudlet and run it.
*Hit the "connect" button which will take you to a selection of MUDs you may want to connect to.
*So fill the blank spaces server adress to the IPv6 address and port to 4242.
*Name the profile "Discworld" or whatever you like, and connect.
Worked for me. The client should remember the MUD from now on, so next time just click on the Discworld banner on the left. --[[User:Xorphitus|Xorphitus]] 14:35, 14 April 2011 (UTC)

===TinyFugue===

TinyFugue 4 (the stable version) doesn't work with IPv6, you need to install version 5. At least on Ubuntu it's package tf5, as opposed to the standard tf package. If you have both installed and want to use version 5 for the tf command, type ''sudo update-alternatives --config tf'' into terminal and choose '/usr/bin/tf5'. Afterwards, you can use the starturtle address to connect to the MUD.

==Using IPv4 Clients==

This usually requires proxy or port forwarding software to accept a local ipv4 connection and reroute it across your ipv6 connection to the mud. This will allow the use of non ipv6 aware clients (mushclient, zmud, cmud, windows clients using wine on linux systems) across ipv6 tunnels.

Note - You do this after you have your IPv6 tunnel working. This is an extra set of steps to use a non IPv6 client over a working IPv6 tunnel!

===Linux===

'''6tunnel'''

Installing 6tunnel (debian / ubuntu, other linuxes and package managers are available):

&lt;pre>
$ sudo apt-get install 6tunnel
&lt;/pre>

Then set up a tunnel to connect your local port of choice (4242?) to port 4242 on the mud's ipv6 address:

&lt;pre>
$ 6tunnel 2a02:8010:6224:2::69 4242
&lt;/pre>

Now configure your ipv4 client to connect to localhost port 4242, and it should be connected to the mud. This works for me with mushclient running under wine, tunneling through the Teredo (using miredo) or Freenet6 (using gogoc) IPv6 networks.

===Windows===

Windows can also do ipv4 to ipv6 port proxying as follows:

&lt;pre>
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov6 listenport=4242 connectaddress=discworld6.obsidian.org.uk connectport=4242
&lt;/pre>

Then just configure your ipv4 client to connect to localhost port 4242 and it should connect to the mud.  This has been tested and works fine in Windows XP (with the free IPv6 tunnel provided by gogo6).

==Help! None of this makes any sense!==
You probably don't need IPv6. Try without it.

Ultimately there's lots of different ways to get a working IPv6 connection to the mud. Assuming you're using Windows and a standard IPv4 client, here's probably the simplest, consisting of simple steps:

*Test the connection by going [https://test-ipv6.com/ here].
*Open a command prompt (by doing Start->Run... and running 'cmd') and enter the following command:
&lt;pre>
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov6 listenport=4242 connectaddress=discworld.starturtle.net connectport=4242
&lt;/pre>
*Finally, set your mud client to connect to '''localhost''', port 4242, instead of discworld.starturtle.net.

This should get you up and running. Good luck!

=== Content from Languages ===
There are nine languages on the Disc, which any player may start with or learn later on:
*[[Agatean]]
*[[Brindisian]]
*[[Djelian]]
*[[Dwarfish]]
*[[Ephebian]]
*[[Grunt]]
*[[Klatchian]]
*[[Morporkian]]
*[[Uberwaldean]]

Each of these except grunt is split into Spoken and Written.

All characters begin with the maximum (100) in both spoken and written forms of the language of the nationality they have chosen to start with. To gain any skill in another language a player must go to one of the many language schools and enroll in lessons. These will only give a basic understanding of a language and to develop their skills further a player must listen to and read a language.

At level 90 in the spoken aspect of a language, you can completely understand everything that [[npc]]s say in that language (though not necessarily everything that other players say in that language). After this point, you can only tm from other players.

It takes 60 spoken before npcs can understand you.

Grunt can be used for speaking but not writing.  Everyone can speak it automatically, but nobody can understand it (it just looks like grunting).  Witches can, however, grunt pointedly enough to produce the desired effect if [[mock]]ing someone while speaking grunt.

===Language schools===
There are several places around the Disc where you can learn languages. They work in different ways.

====Ankh-Morpork Guild of Assassins====
The Kompt de Yoyo is in the Modern Language and Music classroom above ground level and to the east in the [[Guild of Assassins]].

He can teach to assassins for free and to non-assassins for a small fee the basics of written and spoken for the following languages:
*[[Agatean]]
*[[Brindisian]]
*[[Djelian]]
*[[Ephebian]]
*[[Klatchian]]
*[[Morporkian]]
*[[Uberwaldean]]
To request a lesson, do so verbally: "Teach me written/spoken [language] please." You will be asked to type "yes" or "no".

[[Assassins]] can ask the Kompt de Yoyo to tell them stories in different languages, but he refuses to do so for non-assassins.

He also sells [[musical instruments]] and supplies to all.

How it looks like to learn from him: [[Languages/Kompt_Spoilers|This is a spoiler.]]

'''Warning''': You can only get 8 spoken and written levels from him, and doing so prevents you from using all other language schools and training facilities for that specific language, including completing quests that teach it. The only exception to this is the Djelibeybi language school, for unknown reasons.

====Bes Pelargic Language Institute====
This school is located on Serpentine Way, slightly northwest of Tuna Walk.  It offers:
* [[Djelian]], [[Ephebian]], [[Morporkian]], and [[Uberwaldean]] lessons for Agatean students (in other words, the teachers speak Agatean and you must have a certain amount of spoken Agatean to understand the lesson)
* [[Agatean]] lessons for [[Djelian]], [[Ephebian]], [[Morporkian]], and [[Uberwaldean]] students. (Note: It has been reported that Little Agatea gives more levels in Agatean to Morporkian students than the Language Institute{{research}})

* In this school, you can get beginner's, intermediate, and advanced lessons for each language.  You have to wait between lessons, and need a dictionary for them (dictionaries are available in a shop in the school).

Teaching times in all classrooms:
(Please note that different examinations take place at different times of the day)

*Midnight to 7am: Beginners - Repeating phrases said by the teacher.

*8am to 3pm: Intermediate - Looking up words from the 2 last pages in the dictionary.

*4pm to 11pm: Advanced - Multiple choice exam with 10 questions, the answers to which have to be compiled using multiple pages from the dictionary. The Djelian exam differs slightly with every question being one or two words that must be translated.


For Agatean to other languages, upon completion of the exam, the player will be granted 25-35 levels of spoken, and an amount of written that may depend on your score on the exam. 20 to 30 levels has been reported, but with a 10 out of 10 on the exam, you might get from 33 to 45 written (or some number outside that range; this is one person's experience with the four exams). Reasearch{{research}} is needed to check if these figures correspond to foreign speakers learning Agatean.

====Djelibeybi language school====
This school is located on the eastern side of the marketplace in [[Djelibeybi]].  Classrooms are located off a central room on the second floor, and lessons are only available at certain times:

* 1am to 5am - [[Djelian]] Lessons for Klatchian students. East, taught by Dilangelo.
* 6am to 2pm - Djelian Lessons for Morporkian students. East, taught by Dilangelo.
* 9am to 5pm - [[Ephebian]] Lessons for Djelian students. North, taught by Perdikas.
* 10am to 7pm - [[Klatchian]] Lessons for Djelian students. Northeast, taught by Shamil.
* 11am to 8pm - [[Morporkian]] Lessons for Djelian students. South, taught by Angela.
* 3pm to 11pm - Djelian Lessons for Ephebian students. East, taught by Dilangelo.

The southeastern room contains a cord you can &lt;code>pull&lt;/code>, supposedly to get one on one tutoring, but it appears to be useless beyond the sound of a bell ringing in the hall outside {{research}}.

'''Note''': You need good spoken ''and'' written in the language that the teacher uses--spoken to understand them, and written to be able to look up words in the textbook to answer their questions.

Upon enrolling, students must put a 1 talent ({{Djtoon|DjToon 10.00}}) deposit down on a textbook. The student has to bring it along for every lesson. If it gets lost the student can acquire a replacement. The textbook can be returned to the receptionist in the foyer or the language teacher after the exam and the deposit will be refunded.

For the first written lessons, you have to look at the board after a word has been written and then type '''write [characters] board''' to copy the instructor

Upon completing each lesson with the teacher, the student will gain a few levels of spoken and written in the language. The number of levels granted seem to depend somewhat on the intelligence stat.

The first lesson costs 2 talents ({{Djtoon|DjToon 20.00}}) in addition to the textbook fee.

In order to take the second lesson, the student must have 20 spoken levels in the language they are learning, meaning that tming the language on one's own is necessary. This class costs 4 talents ({{Djtoon|DjToon 40.00}}).

For the third lesson, the student must have 40 spoken levels in the language they are learning. This class costs 6 talents ({{Djtoon|DjToon 60.00}}).

To take the exams, the student must have 50 or possibly fewer levels in the language they are learning{{research}}. The exam costs 8 talents ({{Djtoon|DjToon 80.00}}). Note that there is a spoken and written exam that you '''enrol''' for separately. The teacher will suggest to you that you should return your textbook for a refund after the first one you complete - but you should keep it until you complete both exams.

====Ephebian Embassy in Ankh-Morpork====
This school is located just south of the main post office in [[Ankh-Morpork]].  It offers:
* [[Morporkian]] lessons for Djelian and Ephebian students
* [[Ephebian]] lessons for Morporkian students.

In this school you can get only one lesson each in written and spoken, which gives you a small number of levels in the language.

====Ephebian Embassy in Djelibeybi====
This school is located just east of the Square of Ancestors in [[Djelibeybi]].  It offers beginning [[Ephebian]] lessons.

In this school you can get only one lesson each in written and spoken, which gives you a small number of levels in the language.

====Little Agatea====
This school is located in [[Little Agatea]] in [[Ankh-Morpork]], on Whopping Street somewhat northeast of Onion Gate.  It offers:
* [[Agatean]] lessons for Morporkian students. There are a total of four lessons at {{Dollars|$10}} each, and some levels in spoken and written are granted after the final lesson (the number of levels varies, from at least 27 to 35 spoken and from at least 14 to 26 written).
* [[Morporkian]] lessons for Agatean students (beginner lessons only - 5 levels of both spoken and written).

Learning Morporkian here gives much lower results than from the BP Language Institute, while learning Agatean here can give better results than the language institute.

Lessons are only available at certain times here, but there is no wait between them.

====Little Brindisi====

This school is located in Mamma Filomena's sweet bakery in [[Genua]], in Little Brindisi, between Florin Avenue and Savannah Road.

It teaches [[Brindisian]]. The lessons are free and all you have to do is request a lesson - "syntax request".

In order to learn Brindisian, one should have 90 levels of spoken Morporkian.

Mamma Filomena also requests her students to return after they've "practiced a little", just like the Klatchian teacher in Djelibeybi. Lessons can be requested at levels 0, 20 &amp; 40 in spoken Brindisian. If you are over 40 levels then you will be unable to request a lesson.

====Vanya's shack====
This classroom is located on Tobacco Road in [[Ankh-Morpork]], north and slightly east of Shambling Gate.  It offers [[Morporkian]] lessons for Uberwaldean students.

A$5 per lesson

====Copperhead mines====
Hidden in the [[Copperhead mines]] are the means to learn [[Dwarfish]].written and once you have learned it well you will be able to learn [[Dwarfish]].spoken during a [[quest]] also in the [[Copperhead mines]].

==Guild languages==
Some other languages are only available upon joining certain guilds and cannot be learned in any other way.

There are two such guild-specific languages:
*[[Wizard Spells]], available to [[wizards]]
*[[Thieves' Cant]], available to [[thieves]]

'''Wizard Spells''' is used primarily for spellbooks in the various magical libraries. It can also be used by wizards for writing in. It may only be read and written by wizards, and is learned automatically on joining the wizards' guild.

'''Thieves' Cant''' is used primarily for the generally unreadable part of theft receipts, and to sign between certain thieves' guild NPCs and guild members. It can also be used to sign between player members of the guild (this sign language is invisible to non-thieves). It may only be read or signed by thieves, and is learned automatically on joining the thieves' guild.

==Non-player languages==
Other languages that exist, but that are not generally used by players (not being learnable) include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Language !!Can be spoken and heard with [[Tongues]] !!Can be written and read with [[Clarify]]
|-
|[[Gnomish]] ||Yes ||Yes
|-
|[[Komic]] ||Yes ||Yes
|-
|[[Krullian]] ||Yes ||Yes
|-
|[[Tsortean]] ||Yes ||Yes
|-
|[[Common]]/Wommon ||No ||No
|}

Performing [[Tongues]] lets you understand many spoken languages and performing [[Clarify]] lets you understand many written languages as specified above in addition to the learnable languages, but not guild languages.

[[Common]] was a language that everyone understood that is no longer used because it got replaced with many different languages. Items marked (written, embroidered or engraved) in common may be translated at a shop on Upper Broadway in [[Ankh-Morpork]].

==Tips for TMing languages==
You need to be speaking a language ("&lt;code>speak &lt;language>&lt;/code>") to [[TM]] it.  Listening to or reading things in a language you can't understand perfectly, while speaking it, will take [[People.points|people]] [[gp]] equal to your level in the appropriate aspect of the language: if you have 62 levels in spoken Djelian, listening to someone say something in Djelian will cost 62 people gp.  If you don't have enough people gp available, you won't spend ''any'' gp listening to or reading the language, and therefore seem to have no chance to tm; it is therefore advisable to get some levels on [[people.points|people.points]] before trying to [[TM]] a language;

If you spend gp listening to or reading a language you ''will'' gain some XP, whether you TM or not.

===Spoken===
Spoken language can be TMed only by hearing someone else speak it. You need to be speaking in the language (syntax "speak") in order to TM by listening, but you do not need to be saying anything.

If you want to idle somewhere for spoken TMs, the best places to do that are usually the places where you can hear what's said in nearby rooms -- for example, on the Plaza of Broken Moons in [[Ankh-Morpork]], you can hear anything said anywhere in the Plaza from anywhere on it.  These spots also tend to be fairly busy -- an added bonus, since spoken language seems to TM much more easily when you're listening to multiple people.

If you're wandering around, then you should also list the goods or even browse the items of any traders, merchants, vendors, or [[:Category:contractor npcs|contractor npcs]] you see--they'll generally say several lines, one for each thing they're selling.  Note that even if you can't understand them well enough to know what specific items you can browse, you can still browse "all" of them.

[[Pamphlets]] are a popular way of TMing from other players: reading one will make you spam says for a little while, and possibly infect other people so that they do the same.  You can generally TM from listening to a player who is at a higher level (or no more than 9 levels lower) in the language than you are.  Also, if you're grouping with other people who are trying to tm the same language, you can speak the language and then make an alias to group say something, then say it out loud:
&lt;pre>alias gs group say $*$;say $*$&lt;/pre>

You will be able to understand npcs completely when you reach 90 levels of proficiency in speaking, and they will be able to understand ''you'' when you reach 60 levels. Once you reach 90 levels, you can only TM from listening to other players (who still must be no more than 9 levels lower than you).

For locations best for TMing spoken langugages, see the appropriate language article:
*[[Agatean]]
*[[Djelian]]
*[[Ephebian]]
*[[Klatchian]]
*[[Morporkian]]
*[[Uberwaldean]]

The following MUD alias, credited to New, is very useful for helping others TM any language:
&lt;pre>'#Aga $*$;'#Bri $*$;'#Dje $*$;'#Dwa $*$;'#Eph $*$;'#Gno $*$;'#Kla $*$;'#Kom $*$;'#Kru $*$;'#Mor $*$;'#Tso $*$;'#Ube $*$&lt;/pre>

===Written===
Written language can be TMed by reading and writing it. You need to be speaking in the language (syntax "speak") in order to TM it.

This can be done by reading signs in the location where this language is spoken, but a more common approach would be to purchase a '''primer'''. These items are player-created books that contain text written in one or more languages that you can easily carry around and peruse at your own leisure. Primers are often for sale in [[player shops]]. 
Another possibility, which overall seems to be cheaper than primers are [[newspapers]], but they might not be available for all languages.

You can also create your own primer by writing something and reading it ([[Special:Random]] is a good source of text for this, or other varied words like [[Display of tricks]], [[AM Daily]]/[[Green Slab]] articles etc). For a non-native language, you should be able to read and understand completely at 90 levels of proficiency.

===Bonus TMs===
At 90 in a language, you are considered to be fluent in the language.
There is a known bug that has been considered to be not worth fixing and the advantages minimal enough to not be considered abuse that makes it possible to TM spoken beyond 90, up to 99. There is no change to your fluency for these post 90 language skills. There is the possibility of gaining some extra people.points TMs while trying to get to 99 in a language. Mostly, however, the 99 levels in a language is simply a bragging right.

The only way to TM a spoken language past 90 is by listening to another player speaking the language, and their skill must be below 90 but within 9 of yours.

Example: If your language is at 94 levels, you will only consume gp and have a chance to TM  to 95, if you listen to a player speaking it who is at 85-89 in the language.

Similarly, to get that 99th level you will need someone who is at 89.

Written languages have no way to post 90 TM.

==An important note==
If you learn, for example, only written [[Ephebian]] in a language from The Kompt de Yoyo in the [[Guild of Assassins]], '''you will not be able to [[TM]] the other aspect of the language itself''' (in this case, spoken Ephebian) because you only have 0 on that aspect. For TMing the other aspect properly, you will need to learn it from the Kompt de Yoyo.

At a '''money changer''', you can change one type of [[Currency|money]] for another.  There are [[npc]]-run money changers, and changers can also be put into [[player shops]].

==NPC money changers==

Note: Some or all of these rates appear to be variable.  See [[Research:Money changer]].

No money changers handle provincial ("default") (as of 2011-09-27) money.

==Player shop changers==
The changers that can be put in shops depend on the actual coins that have been put into them, so that if you want to change some money to ten-dollars, there have to be enough ten-dollars in it.

You can "list rates on changer" to see the exchange rates that have been set.

==Alternatives==
Some [[bank]]s have branches in locations with different currency, so that it's possible to deposit Lancre money in one branch, and withdraw Morporkian money in another (for example).

=== Content from Moon ===

The current phase of the moon can be determined at night by "look"ing at the sky and by day by "check"ing a stealth watch, which can be bought at the Thieves Guild and Assassin Guild in Ankh-Morpork.

==Phases of the moon==
These are the phases of the moon:
*New moon
*Waxing crescent moon
*First quarter moon
*Waxing gibbous moon
*Full moon
*Waning gibbous moon
*Last quarter moon
*Waning crescent moon
*New moon

=== Content from Nicknames ===

(See "Syntax nickname" for details)

Note that only a single word is used as the nickname, therefore nicknames such as "bBox" and "big.box" are valid. but "big box" will not have the desired result. The latter will not return an error.

==Example==

If the nickname command is used as "nickname big wooden box as bwbox", then the command "look bwbox" is translated to "look big wooden box."

=== Content from Pumpkin_Town ===
When you first start the game you are in '''Pumpkin Town''', the Mud's newbie area.

== Map ==

One of the items you receive is a pumpkin town map.

If you "look map" whilst the "map of pumpkin town" is in your inventory, you will see:

&lt;table>

&lt;/td>
&lt;td>
&lt;pre>

T - morgue / training room (combat, death)
W - street (getting lost, water)
Y - street (safe exploring, water)
&lt;/pre>
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>

The "your location" marker will be in yellow and replace one of the rooms.

"read map" gives the following text:
&lt;pre>
The map shows a little village.  The centre is a 2 by 2 room square, surrounded by several useful buildings.  A travel agency, that could lead you out of Pumpkin Town and into the larger Discworld, is west from the southwest corner; a training room, the town's morgue, a hospital and a crafting workshop are south from the square.  Two shops are at the northeast. Some streets branch off the courtyard too.  Guilds Grove, in the southeast, is surrounded by various rooms, where assassins, thieves, warriors, priests, wizards and witches live.  The village's main street runs along the north and west side of the square.  A night club, jail, post office and garden are connected to the street.
&lt;/pre>
and identifies the room you are in.

== A Guide To Pumpkin Town ==

This is a walkthrough to get the basic skills quickly in Pumpkin Town. It might not be the absolute best sequence, and it might miss some non essentials. If you're a real newbie, it contains a list of the essential items, but there are other things to explore in Pumpkin Town that will help give you a feeling for the mud, how it works, and interacting with it.

===Starting items===
You will start with a lightable torch, a bucket with a champagne bottle in it, a guide, a map, a sash with your name on it and some money. Don't throw everything away yet.

===Getting free levels===
Leave the hut, head for the southeast corner, where the guild rooms are. You can't choose a guild here, but you can start learning some skills.

Go into the wizard room and talk to the wizard. When you find the scroll as you do the other tasks and walk round (text should be in yellow, in the room description), "capture scroll", return to the wizard and "give scroll to wizard". This gives you some magic skill when completed, and combined with the skills from the witch task, gives a total of 5 levels in magic.

Go to the assassin room. Talk to the assassin. When you find the NPC you need to photo as you do the other tasks and walk round, use the camera (hold box, take picture of &lt;npc> using box) and wait for the picture to be ejected from the box before you leave the room the NPC is in. Give the iconograph to the assassin. You will receive some covert points; combined with those from the thief task you will receive 5 levels in the covert skill.

Next, go to the thief room. The thief NPC will tell you to shoplift something from the shop. Go to the shop north of the guild area and shoplift something, preferably the most expensive weapon for the warrior task (read below). Once you're finished, give the stolen item to the thief, you will gain some covert skills; combined with those from the assassin task you will receive 5 levels in the covert skill.

Next, the witch. Before you do what she asks you can go back to the combat training room, wield the hatpin and attack the dummy for misc combat skills. Completing the witch's task gives you some magic skill, and combined with the skills from the wizard task, gives a total of 5 levels in magic.

Go to the general store. The weapon store is upstairs.

You will need to buy the following items. The general store is usually cheaper than the weapon store, but might not have all the items. Work out which item is most expensive, and shoplift it. Then buy the others as you can. You can sell them back to the general store to buy more when you've finished with them.

First set of weapons you need are a mace, a jagged bone sword, and a wooden spear. The mace or the jagged bone sword is probably the one to shoplift.

Now go back to the guild rooms. Visit the warrior room. Do the warcry, pierce, behead and crush attacks. You receive 5 levels of fighting.

Next stop is the combat training room. Equip in turn the jagged bone sword, mace and spear to get another few levels in each of the weapon skills of heavy-sword, mace, and polearm. Keep going until you have 8 levels in each of the skills concerned, you should also get some dodge and parry skills while you do this (keep your response neutral). You can set how you want to respond, be it dodge, parry, block or neutral which is all of the above by typing '''tactics response neutral''' or some other kind of response (note however that block needs a shield to be triggered). You can type '''syntax tactics''' and type '''tactics''' to learn more.

Now take the stolen weapon back to the thief room. Give it to the thief NPC and you will get some covert skills.

Back to the general store, sell the other weapons. You now need to work through flail, misc, dagger, axe and sword weapons, and blocking defence. You can also want to work on striking by attacking the pumpkin without any weapon equipped. Try to use the weapon you're most likely going to use in the game first, since you can't keep attacking the pumpkin (you'll eventually get a message that says, "You have fought the pumpkin for ages now! It's better to just move on - you can learn combat outside of Pumpkin Town too.") You may not be able to afford or carry all the weapons at once (You can only carry 10 items). If not, buy a couple at a time, use them, and sell them back in the general store. If you want to make an offering to Sek for the priest task, hang onto the dagger.

You can do one of seven things to get 5 faith levels (you only need to do one of these, and doing one doesn't change your alignment or commit you to a deity).
# While you have the dagger, hold it, go down to the room below the pumpkin, "get heart from corpse". You can also go to the corpse in the northwest part of town (where there's the ghost). Next, go to the guild rooms, and enter the priest room, and "offer heart to Sek".
# Go to the general store and "search thread". Offer the thread to Fish. 
# You can search one of the tree (outside the quest room) to find a piece of cardboard or if you still have the cardboard box from the assassin task, offer it to Sandelfon.
# Go to the fountain (E on the map) and "fill bucket from fountain" (the bucket you received when you first entered Pumpkin Town). Offer the water to Pishe.
# Buy (do not shoplift) a shirt from the general store, and offer it to Gapp.
# Offer "something unexpected" to Hat. (It seems everything works. Offer the guide or anything you do not need.)
# Go to the general store and "search fluff", or search either the room outside the store or just south of that (C and E on the map). In the priest room, "offer fluff/earmuffs to Gufnork".

===Alignment===
While you're here, you can adjust your [[alignment]] by saving or drowning beetles. This is a good idea if you intend to worship a deity. The limit from neutral is between about 15 and 20 beetles in either direction, and you'll get a message when you've gotten as good (or evil) as you can get. There seems to be a slight random element to it.  You can check your alignment with "score align".

The beetles allow you to set your initial align within the range of very good to very evil.

* Pishe, rescue beetles until you get a message that you're as nice as you can get (very good)
* Gufnork, rescue two or three beetles (good)
* Gapp, rescue one or two beetles (barely good)
* Sandelfon, leave the beetles alone (neutral)
* Fish, drown one or two beetles (barely evil)
* Hat, drown two or three beetles (evil)
* Sek, drown beetles until you get a message that you're as nasty as you can get (very evil)

If you rescue or drown too many beetles, you can reverse the effect by doing the opposite action, so if you find that you got to "very good" and want to worship Gapp, you can drown a few beetles to get back to "barely good".

==What's next==
You can leave Pumpkin Town and select a [[starting location]] from the Travel Agency, just type '''help here''' when you are there.

To leave Pumpkin Town you will need to select a [[starting location]] that will determine not only where you start in the game, but also your nationality, your starting [[language]] and your accent.

See [[starting location]] for more information.

=== Content from Relative_exit ===

Often, if a place uses relative exits, you won't be able to use the normal type of exit--north, south, east, west--there.  The exception is real estate (where you ''see'' relative exits, but can use both).

You can generally use this type of exit even if the room you're in uses the normal type of exits, going "backwards" to go back to the room you just came from, and so on.

You can (usually) see which direction you're facing with the "[[facing]]" command.

You can change the direction you're facing with "[[turn]]":
&lt;pre>turn &lt;around, [half] right, [half] left, rt, lt>&lt;/pre>

The direction you're facing also changes when you move any direction except forwards.

The following things use this type of exit:
*[[Real estate]]
*The library of [[Unseen University]]
*[[L-space]]
*The [[Shonky Shop]]

=== Content from Sailing_guide ===

More specific sailing [[guides]]: [[Sailing guide/Wrangler|Wrangler]], [[Sailing guide/DeckHand|DeckHand]].

== Starting ==
To start, go to Chidder located in the [https://quow.co.uk/cow.php?s=chidder&amp;a=map&amp;m=26&amp;x=121&amp;y=243 Ephebe Underdocks, mysterious cove] as a group of at least 2 players and say "help". He will ask if you and your group are up to the task. say "yes" and the ship will be loaded up with crates and dragons, after which you will be transported to the [[SS Unsinkable]].&lt;br>
From then on, you cannot use the standard north, east, south, and west to walk around. Instead you need to use fore, starboard, aft, and port. To make this navigation more easy, use the sailing related aliases that can be found [[User:Umiven/Aliases#Boat|here]].&lt;br>
''Note: Chidder is flyable''&lt;br>
'''Tip''': Every role can come into contact with fire. A [https://quow.co.uk/cow.php?s=footbath&amp;a=itm&amp;i=battered+tin+footbath battered tin footbath] is a fairly light alternative to the fire buckets that can be filled everywhere by using "fill footbath" and then used to extinguish fires using "pour footbath over fire". I personally use the alias "fbath fill footbath with water; pour footbath over fire" and "ebath empty footbath"

== Searching ==
The first part of the voyage is searching for items to use during your voyage. These can generally be divided into three groups and contain the following important items:
* Fighting: arbalest, arbalest bolt, harpoon, fire axe
* Carpentry: carpenter's hammer, wooden board, iron nail, coil of rope
* Wrangling: lump of coal, shoe polish, lemon, toy balls, toy animals, control rod

Healing items such as box of bandages or towel can be used, but are generally ignored. Most players have their own method of healing: they use potions, bring their own bandages or use magic to cure their wounds if need be.

These can be found in [https://quow.co.uk/cow.php?s=store+a&amp;t=Places&amp;a=map&amp;m=63&amp;x=286&amp;y=151 Store A], [https://quow.co.uk/cow.php?s=store+b&amp;t=Places&amp;a=map&amp;m=63&amp;x=286&amp;y=123 B] and [https://quow.co.uk/cow.php?s=store+c&amp;t=Places&amp;a=map&amp;m=63&amp;x=286&amp;y=91 C]&lt;br>
To increase your chances of finding items, you should "look junk" to see exactly which items are likely to be found in that store. You can then "search &lt;item>" every item that is listed.&lt;br>
It also helps to have a high perception bonus and to hold a quartermaster shovel while searching.

''Note: it is generally good practice to search for a tank, an harpoon, and a rope at the end of your search queue, regardless of whether these items were listed when you looked at the junk. I therefore use the following alias after every round of searching: "sjunk search harpoon; search tank; search rope"''

It is advisable to transport these items per type to a room different than the stores; once the boat starts moving, items on the floor of the stores will disappear back into the pile of junk.&lt;br>
The groups I have sailed with gather the items in the following places:
* Fighting: [https://quow.co.uk/cow.php?s=starboard+side+of+the+upper+deck&amp;t=Places&amp;a=map&amp;m=63&amp;x=143&amp;y=124 starboard side of the upper deck]
* Carpentry: [https://quow.co.uk/cow.php?s=middle+of+the+upper+deck&amp;t=Places&amp;a=map&amp;m=63&amp;x=115 middle of the upper deck (mast)]
* Wrangling: [https://quow.co.uk/cow.php?s=fore+corner+of+the+lower+deck&amp;t=Places&amp;a=map&amp;m=63&amp;x=286&amp;y=63 fore corner of the lower deck (plug)]
* Water tanks: [https://quow.co.uk/cow.php?s=port+boiler+room&amp;t=Places&amp;a=map&amp;m=63&amp;x=258&amp;y=151 port boiler room] or [https://quow.co.uk/cow.php?s=starboard+boiler+room&amp;t=Places&amp;a=map&amp;m=63&amp;x=314&amp;y=151 starboard boiler room]

Regardless where you leave these items, please do not leave wrangling items anywhere below deck other than at the suggested location above. More details on why can be found in my [[Sailing guide/Wrangler|wrangler]] guide.

Once every role has enough items to do their work and the crates are tied down, the wrangler can start heating the boiler(s).

'''Tip''': it may help to make colour triggers for these items per category to get a quick overview of which store hold which type of items when looking at the junk and which room holds which items.

== Sailing ==
From here on out every player fulfils their role as best as possible. For more information on how to do that, see my other guides.

== Fighting ==
Somewhere near the end of the second leg of the voyage, or the start of the third leg of the voyage, you can encounter one of two monsters: the sea serpent and the kraken.&lt;br>
In any case, you need to throw a harpoon or axe (or fire your arbalest) at the monster. You can use "monster" as a target of your attack commands. This will target either the kraken or the sea serpent depending on which is present. For example, I use this alias to throw: "amon take $*$; hold $*$; throw $*$ at monster"&lt;br>
'''Tip''': [[Transcendent Pneumatic Alleviator]] works great to absorb the damaged that these monsters dish out. [[Mama Kolydina's Instant Infestation]] works as well, but does not last as long as [[TPA]].

=== sea serpent ===
The trick to defeating the sea serpent is to time your attacks when it is distracted. It is distracted when it lunges towards, strikes, or reaches for someone.&lt;br>
If that someone is not you, that is the moment to attack.&lt;br>
If that someone is you, it is best to move to a different room, before returning after about 5 heartbeats.

=== kraken ===
The kraken can always be attacked. It attacks players by constricting them with its tentacles. You can see when this happens when a "tentacle snakes around &lt;someone's> legs and coils its way up to &lt;their> torso, binding &lt;them> in an unescapable embrace".&lt;br>
If that someone is not you, you need to "cut &lt;them> free" with an held sharp weapon (I use a [https://quow.co.uk/cow.php?s=Marzipan+dinner+knife&amp;a=itm&amp;i=Marzipan+dinner+knife Marzipan dinner knife], but a fire axe also works).&lt;br>
If that someone is you, best to hope someone is there to cut you free. Otherwise it's best to tell the group that you need to be freed.

=== Content from Save ===

The MUD automatically saves your character upon quitting, [[death]], or getting more of a skill (whether by advancing, learning, or [[tm]]ing).

[[Category:Concepts]][[Category:Commands]][[Category:Innate commands]]

=== Content from Say ===

Said messages are spoken in your currently selected [[language]], so can only be understood by those with sufficient language skills. It is considered a more in-character way to communicate and is often used along with [[emote]] by [[roleplaying|roleplayers]], as well as a means to communicate with [[NPC|NPCs]]. Unlike [[whisper]], said messages can be seen by anyone in the room with you.

==Syntax==

You can say something into the current room simply by typing &lt;code>say &lt;message>&lt;/code> or &lt;code>'&lt;message>&lt;/code>. You can add an adverb to the message, for example &lt;code>say @happily Hello&lt;/code> will output as:
 Womble happily says: Hello

If you and the listener have different [[starting locations]], and their &lt;code>[[options]] output accent&lt;/code> is set to 'unadulterated', the listener will see the speaker's accent in the output. The accent is based on the speaker's starting location and cannot be changed.
 Womble says with a Morporkian accent: I'm from Ankh-Morpork.

However, if you have &lt;code>options output accent = mangle&lt;/code> set, you will not see the accent but instead the spoken text will be edited to be read as the accent is intended.
 Womble says:  I don't know yoo.

If the speaker says something in your starting language, the language will not show up in the output, simple showing as '&lt;speaker> says: &lt;message>' -- this happens even if you are fluent in that language{{research}}. If they speak in a language other than your starting language, this language will be shown in the output:
 Womble says in Morporkian: I'm speaking in Morporkian.

You can change your spoken language by using the &lt;code>language&lt;/code> or &lt;code>speak&lt;/code> commands, or by adding it into the syntax of the say command e.g. &lt;code>say #djelian Hello&lt;/code>.

When adding an exclamation or question mark to the end of your sentence, the output will be amended from 'says' to 'exclaims' or 'asks' respectively.

==lsay and sayto==

There are two variants of the say command that change the output slightly.

'''lsay''' works much in the same way as 'say', but adds the default adverb 'loudly'. The syntax for this is &lt;code>lsay Hello!&lt;/code> or &lt;code>"Hello!&lt;/code>
 lsay Hello!
 You loudly exclaim: Hello!

'''sayto''' is almost identical to 'say', but must be targeted at someone in the same room as you.
 sayto Womble Hello Womble
 You say to Womble: Hello womble

=== Content from SSL ===

This means that if your mud client supports SSL you can simply use:
&lt;pre>
host discworld.starturtle.net and port 4245
&lt;/pre>

If your mud client does not support SSL, then you can use [[stunnel]] to tunnel your connection through SSL.

The MUSHclient author suggests using the TorBrowser as a proxy instead of Stunnel: https://www.mushclient.com/forum/?id=14780&amp;reply=21
