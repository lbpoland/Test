=== Content from Friend ===

Friending is invisible; someone cannot directly tell whether you have them as a friend.

==Syntaxes==
Adding a person or club as a friend with no tag will give them a default tag of "needs no introduction".  Their tag shows up in informs and in the verbose version of your friend list.

* &lt;tt>friends&lt;/tt>: Lists all your friends and their tags, each on a separate line.
* &lt;tt>friends list &lt;string>&lt;/tt>: Lists friends whose tags contain the specified string.
* &lt;tt>friends online&lt;/tt>: Lists all of your friends who are online at the moment, verbosely.
* &lt;tt>friends brief&lt;/tt>: Lists all your friends, separated by commas and without tags.
* &lt;tt>friends add &lt;friend> &lt;tag>&lt;/tt>: Adds a player to your list, with a custom tagl
* &lt;tt>friends add &lt;friend>&lt;/tt>: Adds a player to your list.
* &lt;tt>friends remove &lt;friend>&lt;/tt>: Removes a player from your list.
* &lt;tt>friends add club &lt;club>&lt;/tt>: Adds a club to your list--this effectively adds everyone in the club to your friends list, much tidier than adding everyone individually.
* &lt;tt>friends add club &lt;club> &lt;tag>&lt;/tt>: The same as the above, but with a custom tag.
* &lt;tt>friends remove club &lt;friend>&lt;/tt>: Removes a club from your list.
* &lt;tt>friends club &lt;friend>&lt;/tt>: Shows whether that club is your on your list, and if so, what tag you've given it.
* &lt;tt>friends cleanup&lt;/tt>: Removes characters who no longer exist from your list.
* &lt;tt>friends clear&lt;/tt>: Deletes your entire list.
* &lt;tt>friends &lt;friend>&lt;/tt>: Shows whether that person is your friend, and if so, what tag you've given them.

"Friends" can be replaced with "friend" in any of the above.

==Informs==
"&lt;tt>Inform friend&lt;/tt>" will make it so that you get a notice whenever someone on your list of friends logs on or off.

==Earmuffs==
You can set your [[:Category:Options#Earmuff|earmuffs]] to allow your friends through with "&lt;tt>earmuffs allowfriends&lt;/tt>".  So, if you have multiple-tells earmuffed, and your earmuffs set to allowfriends, your friends will be able to send you multiple-tells, but nobody else will be able to.

==Autoaccept==
You can set each [[:Category:Options#Auto|autoaccept option]] to automatically accept certain things from your friends:
*auto death: automatically let them perform [[Raise Dead]] and/or [[Resurrect]] on you
*auto follow: automatically accept follow requests
*auto give: automatically let them give things to you
*auto show: automatically accept requests to show you things
*auto teach: automatically let them learn things from you

==Custom furniture==
*You can make [[quilting|quilts]] to hang on your walls.
*[[Virgo Vango]] in [[Brass Neck]] can paint portraits to your specifications, which can be hung up.
*Furniture can be [[Delusions of Grandeur|deluded]] and its new name will show up in the room description (with an article: "In the southwest corner is a wooden rain barrel near which is a Mystic Pond" with Mystic Pond being the deluded name).
*Furniture from {{Itemdbshop|694|Chester Oakshanks's furniture shop in Mad Stoat}} can be [[paint]]ed or polished with [[wax]].  Furniture from {{Itemdbshop|693|a colourful furniture shop on Phedre Road}} can also be painted.

==Wanted furniture==
The following furniture is missing from the list and may have capacity:
*{{Itemdb|918|picture frame}}
*{{Itemdb|6221|dragon egg candle holder}}

==Placing Furniture==
Furniture can be placed in several positions around the room, against the walls, on the ceiling, in the corners, in the centre. One piece can be placed exactly and three pieces can be placed near a specified location. 

Some pieces of furniture include options for specific descriptions such as hanging, squatting, lurking--you can see these with "place help &lt;furniture>".

Hanging furniture can also be placed hanging on a wall that already has a ground furniture placed against it, so that the hanging piece hangs above the other. This is useful for say a fireplace and a mantle.

For the ceiling, hanging furniture may be placed either "on" or "hanging from" the ceiling.  Using "place &lt;furniture> so it is hanging from the ceiling" will result in something like, "Hanging from the centre of the ceiling is a &lt;furniture>."  On the other hand, using "place &lt;furniture> on the ceiling" will result in something like, "In the centre of the ceiling is a &lt;furniture>." which may be more desirable for flat furniture such as posters or mirrors.

Some more examples of the syntax:

&lt;pre>
place wardrobe in the ne corner
place chest near the ne corner
place chest 2 near the ne corner
place chest 3 near the wardrobe
place gilded chest so it is glittering in the centre
place sofa against the east wall
place plaque so it is hanging on the east wall
&lt;/pre>

You can place a maximum of ten pieces of furniture in a room and only placed furniture saves.

See [[Real_estate_decoration#Placing_furniture_and_its_appearance_in_the_room|Placing furniture and its appearance in the room]] for more details about how the room description changes based on how furniture is placed in it.

The spell '''Fyodor's Nimbus of Porterage''' is a miscellaneous wizard spell requiring a candle and a wet towel. It creates a cloud to carry your items.


==Casting==
This spell costs 75 GP to cast, and takes up 35 units of [[mind space]].  It is cast on '''&lt;span style="color:#c00000">''an item''&lt;/span>''', which the cloud picks up when it appears. Despite this, almost everyone seems to think you have to cast it on the towel. They're wrong!

===Components===
A candle and a wet towel are required. Neither are typically consumed in the casting. 

The towel may sustain damage during the casting. If the towel is too badly damaged, it will eventually break. If it is too dry, it will disappear.

The initial colour of the cloud is derived from the towel, whenever possible. Otherwise, the cloud can be ordered to "change colour" as desired, within the range of black to white shades.

;Fail (caster already has a cloud)
{{Prebox| A cloud of white fog appears from nowhere, envelops you and makes you really, really soaked.}}

;What others see
&lt;pre>Wizard unwraps a wet towel carefully.  
Wizard lights a candle and attempts to ignite her towel.  
Wizard stares at the steaming towel and looks somewhat disappointed.

Wizard's face muscles relax gradually, and you see grim determination in her eyes.  
The air in front of Wizard swirls and darkens and forms a cardamom brown cloud.  
Wizard looks tired.&lt;/pre>

==Clouds==
The spell creates a cloud which the caster can give objects to carry.  The caster can interact with the cloud using the following syntaxes:

 give &lt;item> to &lt;cloud>
 order &lt;cloud> to {take|grab|carry|lift|get} &lt;object>
 order &lt;cloud> to {release|drop} &lt;object>
 order &lt;cloud> to return &lt;object> 
 order &lt;cloud> to follow
 order &lt;cloud> to change colour
 poke &lt;cloud>
 order &lt;object> to {surround|envelop|swallow} &lt;someone> 

The size and therefore the weight capacity of the cloud depend on the caster's skills. If the cloud has no objects to carry, it will dissipate after a short, variable period (it's possible to give the cloud items during this time to prevent it from disappearing). Given too many objects to carry, it will fumble some of its contents. If the cloud is ordered to return something but it doesn't, the caster would have been too heavily burdened with the object.

The cloud will also dissipate (dropping anything it was carrying) if the caster logs off.  If they log back on quickly enough, the cloud may ''not'' dissipate, but it may need to be poked.

The caster can have more than one cloud (Maximum appears to be 3).  However, it's harder to summon a cloud if you already have one.

Ordering the cloud to surround someone (including yourself) makes that person soaking wet - however this weakens the cloud each time, and done enough times will result in a cloud that can barely carry anything at all, and will even drop the items it was already holding.

==Stat effects==
The caster shares some mental and physical powers with the cloud, thus [[intelligence]] and [[strength]] are reduced for several minutes while the caster recovers. The stats may be returned to normal with the [[Restore]] ritual, the restoration slide in the [[Pishe Waterpark]], being inside the Ephebian horse or offering hearts to the low altar of Sek in Morpork.

Intelligence is reduced by 1 to 2 points, while strength is reduced by 2 to 3 points. After fifteen minutes, penalties of 2 or 3 points are reduced to penalties of 1 point, while penalties of 1 point are removed. All stat penalties thus fade completely after exactly half an hour.

==Example alias==

fnp - Fyodor's Nimbus of Porterage (may be used on something that is unkept)
 alias fnp cast Fyodor's Nimbus of Porterage on $*$

csum - Cloud '''Summon''' utilizing [[Wurphle's Midnight Snack]] *Needs bag and jar and pack for alias to work* ('''Caution''': [[Wurphle's Midnight Snack]] is harder to cast than just casting [[Fyodor's Nimbus of Porterage]] alone and requires a total of 110 GP to use this alias)
 alias csum take glass jar from pack; cast Wurphle's Midnight Snack with creating white wine into glass jar; take towel from pack; pour glass jar onto towel; put glass jar in pack; take candle from pack; remove bag; cast Fyodor's Nimbus of Porterage on bag; cd; put candle &amp; towel in pack; take money from pack; give money to my cloud; poke cloud; order my cloud to follow me

cgiv - Cloud '''Give''' (Allows to give things to cloud)
 alias cgiv give $*$ to my cloud

cget - Cloud '''Get''' *Needs bag for alias to work* (This allows the cloud to gather money from corpses and a specific group of items to be collected as well as to put the items into the container and to carry it again)
 alias cget take jewellery from corpses; order my cloud to get money from corpses; order my cloud to drop midnight black bag; put unkept jewellery in midnight black bag; order my cloud to carry midnight black bag; bury corpses; look

'''Grisald's Reanimated Guardian''' (abbreviated as '''GRG''') is an first order defensive [[:Category:Wizard spells|spell]]. The caster can use the spell to raise human (And only human) corpses into a completely loyal skeleton warrior, who will fight for you and try to defend you from attacks.

You can only summon one skeleton at a time.

Failing the spell can destroy the corpse, dropping any items on it on the floor. It may also make the caster unconscious or make the skeleton turn on the caster.

You do not receive bury [[xp]] if you cast Grisald's Reanimated Guardian on a corpse before burying it.

==Casting==
This spell costs 70 GP to cast, and takes up 40 units of [[mind space]], and can be cast on any human corpse whose skeleton is still intact.

&lt;br>The wizard strokes the corpse of a tall man lovingly.
&lt;br>The skeleton groans, stirs and rises.}}

==Skeleton Warriors==
Skeleton warriors are a type of [[minion]] that will automatically assist the caster in combat and [[defend]] them.

===Description===
&lt;pre>A walking skeleton.  Bits look like they're about to fall off, or already have.  It looks slightly out-of-touch with the world, and (How 'fierce' your skeleton is will be displayed here).&lt;/pre>

===Usage===
The skeleton will use any weapons or armours on the corpse when it is reanimated. If the skeleton does not have any weapons, shields, or other items it can parry with, it will not [[defend]] the caster. If you give the skeleton weapons or armours, it will remove all of its equipment and then equip as much as it can, and it will carry any remaining items rather than drop them. All items will drop when the skeleton is destroyed.

Skeletons cannot be given orders. You may &lt;code>lose&lt;/code> a skeleton to make it stop following you or &lt;code>poke&lt;/code> it to make it resume following you after a brief delay.
&lt;pre>You poke the skeleton warrior.
The skeleton warrior lurches to attention.&lt;/pre>

You cannot have more than one skeleton in existence at a time. If you want to create a new skeleton or retrieve equipment from an old one, you can 'relinquish control over skeleton', wait for it to die or manually kill it yourself. Your skeleton will attack you if you attack it.

===Characteristics===
The skeleton's fighting ability and lifespan are highly random, but they may be increased with higher skills{{research}}. Durations of nearly an hour have been reported by high level wizards. A skeleton's lifespan cannot be extended. You may get a general idea of a skeleton's power and lifespan by looking at it and seeing how 'fierce' it is. You will be notified when its lifespan is drawing to an end.

Skeletons may be given [[TPA]] to make them tougher. Skeletons cannot be [[bandage]]d, but they may be healed by other means such as an [[oak wand]].

Unlike some types of [[minions]], skeletons do not reduce your kill and bury [[xp]].

The skeleton can also buy goods from one of the [[Dibbler clones]]

As of Change #955, skeletons can now traverse difficult terrain with greater ease.

===Death===
&lt;pre>The skeleton warrior dissolves into dust.  Everything he carried drops to the ground.&lt;/pre>

=== Content from Groups ===

==Getting started==
Generally, when you are just starting out the best ways to get a group started will be to advertise your own availability to join a group using the "group request" command or look for other players who have already placed a group request.

===Placing a group request===
 > group request on whee
 You place a grouping request.

===Looking for other groups and requests===
"Groups" by itself, or "group list" will give you a list of the current groups, with group requests (if any) at the bottom.  People who are hiding (possibly only if you couldn't see them if you were in the room{{Research}}) don't show up on this list.
 > groups
 
 There is currently one grouping request:
  + whee - Rig

"Groups here" will give you a list of groups with representatives in the room you're in.

===Turning off a group request===
 > group request off
 You withdraw your grouping request.

===Starting a group===
 > group create name
 You begin an adventuring group.
 [whee] You have joined the group.
 [whee] You are now the leader of the group.

===Inviting others into your group===
 > group invite &lt;nowiki>&lt;player>&lt;/nowiki>
 [whee] &lt;nowiki>&lt;player>&lt;/nowiki> has been invited by you.
 > [whee] &lt;nowiki>&lt;player>&lt;/nowiki> has joined the group.

===Following===
 &lt;nowiki>&lt;player>&lt;/nowiki> is requesting to be able to follow you.  Use 'follow accept &lt;nowiki>&lt;player>&lt;/nowiki>'.
 [whee] &lt;nowiki>&lt;player>&lt;/nowiki> requests to follow you and you request to follow him.
 &lt;nowiki>&lt;player>&lt;/nowiki> accepts the follow request from you.
 > follow accept &lt;nowiki>&lt;player>&lt;/nowiki>
 You accept the follow request from &lt;nowiki>&lt;player>&lt;/nowiki>.


==Group commands==
Players obtain a variety of group specific commands when in a group, a list of which is available using the command "syntax group".  A short description of what that group command does can be accessed using "group help &lt;nowiki>&lt;sub-command>&lt;/nowiki>".

===Group status===
This gives you an estimate of all group members' [[hit points|health]] and [[guild points]], tells you who the leader is, and tells you how idle group members are (if any have been idle for more than 15 seconds).

You can also use "group report" to report your own status to the group.

====Health====
This is what the health-related messages mean:
{|class="wikitable" border="1"
!Health level !! Target's HP
|-
| 'unhurt' || 	At maximum health
|-
| 'almost unhurt' || At or over 95%, and less than their maximum
|-
| 'scratched (white)' || At or over 91%, and less than 95% of their maximum
|-
| 'scratched (green)' || At or over 90%, and less than 91% of their maximum
|-
| 'slightly hurt' || At or over 81%, and less than 90% of their maximum

|-
| 'badly wounded' || At or over 31%, and less than 41% of their maximum
|-

|-
| 'perfectly healthy, for a ghost' || 0 hit points--usually, dead&lt;ref>When someone has 0 hit points, but is merely unconscious (as from [[Feedback]]), this message is also used.&lt;/ref>
|}

====Guild points====
This is what the guild point-related messages mean:
{|class="wikitable" border="1"
!Energy level !! Target's GP
|-
| 'refreshed' || At maximum gp.
|-
| 'clear of mind' || At or over 91%, and less than 100% of their maximum.
|-
| 'concentrated' || At or over 81%, and less than 91% of their maximum.
|-
| 'slightly confused' || At or over 71%, and less than 81% of their maximum.
|-
| 'confused' || At or over 61%, and less than 71% of their maximum.
|-
| 'slightly fatigued' || At or over 51%, and less than 61% of their maximum.
|-
| 'fatigued' || At or over 41%, and less than 51% of their maximum.
|-
| 'very fatigued' || At or over 31%, and less than 41% of their maximum.
|-
| 'highly fatigued' || At or over 21%, and less than 31% of their maximum.
|-
| 'severely fatigued' || At or over 11%, and less than 21% of their maximum.
|-
| 'near unconscious' || Less than 11% of their maximum.
|}

===Group assist===
If you "group assist" someone, then you'll automatically join in (after a short delay) if they are attacked by something.  You can "group unassist" them to stop, it does not require any further arguments and will stop you assisting any/all group members currently assisted.

The length of time before you join in is apparently dependent on your [[adventuring.perception]]. Only one person can be assisted at one time.

You can also use group unassist to cancel your assists and "group relieve" to force people to stop assisting you.

Since you only join combat when you or the group member you're assisting is attacked, you may notice some situations where you don't join combat immediately. For example, if you're in a group of 3 players and enter a [[dangerous area]] with aggressive enemies like the [[Shades]], an enemy may begin attacking your third group member. Since the enemy is neither attacking you nor the group member you're assisting, you will not join combat until they do.

===Group shields===
Shows any [[:Category:Arcane shielding|arcane shielding]] that group members are currently using.  The output is similar to [[shields]].

==Sharing xp==
Kill and burial xp is shared with groupmates who are:
* In the same room or one room away, but no further, and
* Less than five minutes idle.

Noncombatant groupmates will get shared xp--but this doesn't reduce the amount of xp the combatants get; it's just free xp for their groupmates.

Among the combatant groupmates, each person will typically get less xp than they would have by killing the npc solo, but the combined amount of xp will be more than that, making it advantageous to group.  See [[Experience_points#Division_and_sharing_of_kill_and_burial_xp|division and sharing of kill and burial xp]] for more details.

If you do a [[Sam Slager|sausage-making mission]] while grouped, the xp is split evenly between the group members.  E.g., with two group members, each will get exactly half the solo amount.  Money is similarly split.  (The split happens ''before'' any reduction from having done a similar mission within the last hour--so if one person is getting said reduction, it doesn't affect the other's xp.)

Job market missions don't appear to share xp.

{{Infobox command

'''Guard''' is a [[Warrior]] only command which is used to attempt to prevent people from using one particular exit.

It costs 25gp for each 5 second period that someone is attempting to evade the exit you are guarding.

Whenever someone attempts to use an exit which is blocked the [[fighting.defence.blocking]] of the person doing the blocking is checked against the [[fighting.defence.dodging]] of the person trying to get past.

It is possible to guard an exit against everyone or only some defined by name, gender, race and adjectives.

Note that while you can guard an exit against specific players, you cannot guard an exit against specific NPCs (e.g. "troll 2") but only against types of NPCs (e.g. "chickens", "young trolls"). Note also that gender-based guarding (e.g. "men") will match male non-human NPCs as well as male human NPCs.

You cannot guard more than one exit at the same time. You can stop guarding an exit to guard another.

It is also used in [[CTF]] to protect the flagpole.

==Regeneration==
The rate at which a player's guild points are regenerated is based on the player's stat points distribution (initially all stats are 13 and they can be changed by [[rearrange]]) and the number of each stats of the skill that is their primary GP skill described in the table above.

For example, [[magic.points]] has the five stats &lt;tt>IISWW&lt;/tt>, where I = intelligence, S = strength and W = wisdom, so nb_con=0, nb_dex=0, nb_int=2, nb_str=1, nb_wis=2.

Specifically, the formula to calculate GP regen is:

&lt;pre>GP regen per round = rounddown(sqrt(175/9.8 * (nb_con * ln(con) + 
                                               nb_dex * ln(dex) +
                                               nb_int * ln(int) +
                                               nb_str * ln(str) +
                                               nb_wis * ln(wis)) - 43.75) - 10)&lt;/pre>

Research indicates that there is on average one round every 2 seconds. Therefore:
*2 gp regen per round gives an average of 1 gp per second
*3 gp regen per round gives an average of 1.5 gp per second
*4 gp regen per round gives an average of 2 gp per second

==Boosting guild points==
Various means exist within the game to provide an instantaneous boost to guild points:
*Burying killed victims provides a small amount of GP (10 GP per corpse buried).
*[[Energy tea]] can provide a substantial amount of GP as well as boost the maximum total, though there is a penalty when it wears off.
*[[Pink crystal ring]]s provide varying amounts of GP when twisted.
*[[:Category:Stat items|Stat items]] and other stat effects can affect the underlying stats for the relevant points skill.  This affects both the maximum and the current level.

==Drains and penalties==
As well as the GP cost incurred by performing [[:Category:Commands|commands]], some other aspects can cause a GP drain.

*[[:Category:Stat items|Stat items]] or other stat effects (such as those produced by [[poison]]) can lower the maximum GP and current level, as well as potentially affecting the renegeneration rate.
*[[Yellow stone ring]]s consume GP at regular intervals.
*The [[hide]], [[sneak]], [[ambush]] and [[fade]] commands consume small amounts of covert GP at regular intervals in order to keep the player in hiding. Furthermore, [[sneak]] consumes covert GP with each move between rooms, depending on sneak level.
*The [[watch]] command consumes gp at regular intervals to keep the player's perception higher.
*The player's combat attitude imparts a GP drain as follows:

=== Content from Heartbeat ===
One '''heartbeat''' is generally two seconds.  However, it's said to vary sometimes with lag.

==Heartbeat-based effects==
There are a few things that happen on each heartbeat:
*You get a small amount of [[xp]], known as "heartbeat xp".  This starts at 3 xp per heartbeat and is decreased as your xp rate gets above 500,000 xp per hour.
*If injured, you will also--usually--regenerate a small number of [[hp]].  The exact number depends on your [[constitution]] and [[strength]], varying from 2 to 6 within the range of possible unmodified stats, with 4 being the rate that all 13's gives you.  With very damaged stats, you may have a regeneration rate of 0.
*If you have less than full [[gp]], you will regenerate a small number of gp.  The exact number depends on your guild and stats (the specific stats it depends on varies with guild).  Natural regeneration rates vary from 1 to 4, with 3 being the rate that all 13's gives you.  With very damaged stats, you may have a regeneration rate of 0.
*If you have less than full [[social points]], you regenerate one.

Oddly enough, being [[death|dead]] doesn't seem to stop your heartbeat, as your xp and gp still increase while you are a ghost (however, this is only ''visible'' with certain clients or plugins that can update from mxp, since being dead means you cannot view your score).

Apparently, having a heartbeat is required in order to take part in fights.

Some effects, such as [[Major Shield]], seem to have a duration measured in heartbeats.

==Restarting your heartbeat==
The "restart" command restarts your heartbeat if it is stopped by a bug.

=== Content from Heatstroke ===

==Catching heatstroke==
Staying in a hot area like the desert, especially near the stone column west of the oasis, will cause heatstroke if insufficient cooling clothes are worn or other measures are not taken. Some areas may still be too hot.

A convenient place to get heatstroke is Sek's high altar in Bes Pelargic, as it is "incredibly, unbelievably hot" there.

==Effects==
Heatstroke will eventually give -1 to both [[intelligence]] and [[wisdom]], increasing to -2 in both somewhere around the point you are "close to [[death]] from extreme heatstroke", then increasing further to -3, then -4, then -5. The stat penalty can also go down while you still have heatstroke. 

Heatstroke can kill and should not be taken lightly. If you are cooking rapidly and you are already warm, apply measures to immediately reduce your temperature.

==Curing heatstroke==
Standing somewhere cool and removing warm clothing is recommended. Getting wet also helps a little, which should happen automatically when you sweat because of the heat.

Priests can perform the ritual [[Cool]] repeatedly to reduce one's [[temperature]].

==Disease progression==
{{research}}

==Preventing heatstroke==
*Don't stay too long in very hot areas like the exposed desert, try to find some shade.
*Don't stay too long in a smithy if wearing too many warming clothes.
*Bring cooling clothes (don't count on metal armour pieces since they won't cool when it gets too hot) and remove warming clothes.
*Have a priest can perform [[Cool]] on you.
*Wear an [[elegant ring]] from casting [[Gillimer's Ring of Temperate Weather]] to regulate your [[temperature]].
*Have a wizard cast [[Patient Taming of the Quantum Weather Butterfly]] to cool the room.

=== Content from Hit_points ===

==Maximum hit points==
[[File:HP-weight-factor.gif|HP to weight factor|right]]
The maximum amount of hit points a player has is mostly controlled by their bonus in [[adventuring.health]].  There is also an effect from the player's weight.

To determine a player's maximum hit point total, read off the 'weight factor' from the graph to the right based on the player's weight, and then apply the following formula:&lt;br>&lt;br>

{{Prebox|Max HP {{=}} floor( (150 + 10 * [[constitution|con]] + 4 * [[adventuring.health|ad.he bonus]]) * ''weight-factor'' )}}

{{-}}

==Hit point regeneration==
The rate at which hitpoints regenerate is controlled by the player's [[constitution]] and [[strength]] stats, with a stronger emphasis on the former.  Specifically, it is:&lt;br>&lt;br>
{{Prebox|HP regen per round {{=}} rounddown(sqrt(200/9.8 * (4 * ln(con) + ln (str)) - 50) - 10)}}&lt;br>

==Ways to recover hit points==
:''See also: [[:Category:Healing]]''

Beyond waiting for them to [[Hit_points#Hit_point_regeneration|regenerate]], players can recover hit points via any of the following means:
*Drink [[healing tea]] (restores health over time or [[blue water]] (instant boost).
*Eat a [[chocolate sword]] or some [[Healing Food|foods]].
*Smell a [[healing rose]] (restores health over time).
*[[Perform]] any of the following [[:Category:Rituals|priest rituals]]:
**[[Cure Light Wounds]]
**[[Cure Medium Wounds]]
**[[Cure Serious Wounds]]
**[[Heal]]
*[[Bandage]] with a strip of cloth.
*[[Zap]] with an [[oak wand]].
*Heal with the [[blade of Soyin]].
*Relax in some [[hot springs]] or [[PK combat arena]] baths.

Players can also use [[:Category:stat items|stat items]] to increase their [[constitution]] or [[strength]] stats, which may result in an increase in the natural hit point regeneration rate.

[[Splint]] can be used when legs are broken to reduce damage done when walking and to mend your legs after some time.

For most [[horse]] illnesses you can ask a witch for [[treat]].

==Viewing hitpoints==
Players can view their current and maximum hitpoints via the [[score]] command.  If the player is in combat or otherwise in most situations where the player takes damage, the [[monitor]] will show up detailing their current and maximum hitpoints.

Players can see ''approximately'' what fraction of their maximum hitpoints another character has by using the [[health_(command)|health]] command, or if [[groups|grouped]] with that player, by using 'group status'.

=== Content from Hypothermia ===

==Catching hypothermia==
Players catch hypothermia by being in a sufficiently cold environment (after taking into account the warmth of their clothing) for a long enough time.

The rate of progression of hypothermia is proportional to the difference in the player's current warmth and the 'comfortable temperature' - so the less warming clothing a player is wearing and the colder the environment, the faster the disease progresses.

==Effects==
*Initially, the only effect of hypothermia is to make the player shiver.
*After a while, the player will suffer periodic stat drops (initially -1 [[strength]], and then -1 to both [[constitution]] and [[strength]], up to -3 constitution and -4 strength before death), occurring approximately once every four minutes.  When this happens, the player receives either the message, "You're so cold you feel your energy being drained," or, later, the message, "You're so cold you feel as though you're about to expire."
*Eventually, the player will suffer death if remaining in a state of hypothermia for too long.

==Curing hypothermia==
Hypothermia is cured within 20 seconds of entering a sufficiently warm room.

Priests can perform the ritual [[Warm]] repeatedly to increase one's [[temperature]].

==Disease progression==
You can tell how far the disease has progressed by looking at the victim:
#''&lt;Player> looks a bit cold'' - shivering only.
#''&lt;Player> looks rather cold'' - shivering only.
#''&lt;Player> looks very cold'' - shivering, stat drops set in half-way through this stage.
#''&lt;Player> looks sick from hypothermia - shivering, stat drops.
#''&lt;Player> looks close to death from hypothermia'' - shivering, stat drops, '''danger'''.
#'''Death'''

==Preventing hypothermia==
*Don't stay too long in areas that are insanely cold such as outside the [[Temple of the Listening Monks]], try going inside buildings.
*Bring warm clothes to raise your [[temperature]], and remove cooling clothes.
*Have a priest perform [[Warm]] on you.
*Wear an [[elegant ring]] from casting [[Gillimer's Ring of Temperate Weather]] to regulate your [[temperature]].
*Have a wizard cast [[Patient Taming of the Quantum Weather Butterfly]] to warm the room.

}}

&lt;pre>
With the Agatean iai technique (lit. "To free the blade to cut open the bellies of the unworthy dogs") you can draw a weapon from its scabbard and attack your opponent in one movement. To use this technique one of your hands must be free, and a sword suitable for a slicing or slashing motion must be in a scabbard. Iai is used to initiate combat, so you can't be fighting while using this command. Your skill in fighting.special.weapons determines your ability to prepare, which costs 60 fighting points, and your skill in fighting.melee.sword determines your ability to hit your opponent. Your skill in your chosen weapon determines the efficacy of your attack.
&lt;/pre>

==Notes==
* You cannot use iai while fighting other targets in the same room ("You can't use this technique during combat.").
* There is a hard coded time out of 5 seconds between two successive uses of iai. So, when having killed the first target within a few seconds with this technique, you will be responded with "You are already doing that." if you want to repeat the iai technique on a second target too fast.

{{Infobox command
 | gp=35/40/45
 |learntat=150 of [[fighting.special.weapon]]
 | skills=[[Fighting.special.weapon]] and [[Fighting.melee]] for the weapon used
 | items=A piercing [[weapon]] [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Impale|that allows impale]]
 | guild=[[Warriors Guild|Warriors]]
}}

'''Impale''' is a [[:Category:Warrior commands|warrior-only command]] that is used mid combat. Whether a weapon is capable of impaling can be found through use of the [[judge]] command.

[[Special:WhatLinksHere/Impale| Pages that link to this page]]: mostly weapons that this command can be used with.

__TOC__
{{-}}
==Acquisition==
Impale can be learned at 150 levels of [[fighting.special.weapon]] from a guild instructor or from another player who has the command.

== Syntax ==
 impale &lt;target> with &lt;weapon>
 impale &lt;target> &lt;random|guts|legs|head|back|neck|hands|feet|arms|side> with &lt;weapon>
 impale compare &lt;zone 1> with &lt;zone 2>

== Target zones ==
Damage, preparation difficulty, launch difficulty and guild point cost will depend on the zone targeted. From weakest to most damaging the target zones and associated guild point cost are:
 35gp hands|feet
 35gp legs
 35gp arms
 35gp side
 40gp neck
 45gp guts|back
 45gp head
Generally the launch difficulty is constant and the preparation difficulty scales with damage but there are two exceptions where:
*an impale targeting the guts (45gp) is easier to prepare than one targeting the neck (40gp), though it inflicts more damage'
*an impale targeting the back is hardest to prepare of all but is easier to launch.

== Impale messages ==

If a successful impale kills the target, a special message may be displayed.

*You skewer the &lt;victim's> &lt;body part> with your &lt;weapon>, causing several jets of blood to spray out, covering the area in a fine red mist.  In another medium, this might qualify as abstract art.

*As you drive your &lt;weapon> into the &lt;victim's> &lt;body part> and yank it free, the wound spurts blood relentlessly, draining &lt;his/her/its> last drops of life.  Clean-up on aisle &lt;number>.

*As you skewer &lt;him/her/it>, the &lt;victim> struggles against your &lt;weapon> briefly, until gravity catches up to &lt;him/her/it>, dragging &lt;him/her/it> to the ground and off the weapon.

*You fatally impale the &lt;victim> on your &lt;weapon>, &lt;his/her/its> lifeblood gushing from the wound as you withdraw your weapon.

*You shove your &lt;weapon> right through the &lt;victim's> &lt;body part>, the bloodied weapon bursting messily out the other side.

*You bury your &lt;weapon> in the &lt;victim's> &lt;body part>, then pull it free with a pop like a cork escaping a bottle of champagne.  However, instead of bubbly, a tide of gore erupts.  Cheers.

*You impale the &lt;victim's> &lt;body part> with your &lt;weapon>, twisting it inside &lt;him/her> before yanking it free.  Un-skewered, &lt;his/her> corpse slumps to the ground.

*You launch a powerful attack with your &lt;weapon>.  The &lt;victim> staggers around, trying desperately to plug the hole in &lt;his/her/its> &lt;body part>.  Maybe in &lt;his/her/its> next life, &lt;he/she/it>'ll make sure that &lt;he/she/it> knows where &lt;his/her/its> towel is.

*You launch a powerful attack with your &lt;weapon>.  The &lt;victim> attempts to say some last words as your &lt;weapon> drives through &lt;his/her/its> &lt;body part>: Gurgle, gurgle, aaargh.

*You sheath your &lt;weapon> in the &lt;victim>'s eye.  As &lt;he/she/it> falls to the ground, you withdraw the weapon, wiping it clean before looking around for another opponent.

*&lt;His/Her/Its> &lt;body part> pierced by your &lt;weapon>, the &lt;victim> hops around briefly.  Cradling &lt;his/her/its> bleeding extremity, &lt;he/she/it> falls over, &lt;his/her/its> screams ending as &lt;he/she/it> collapses to the ground.

*You launch a powerful attack with one of your &lt;weapon>.  The &lt;victim> attempts to say some last words as your &lt;weapon> drives through &lt;his/sher/its> &lt;body part>: Tell my &lt;children/wife's lover> that I...

*You launch a powerful attack with one of your &lt;weapon>.  For a moment, you and the &lt;victim> stare at each other, before the &lt;victim> collapses, a gaping hole in &lt;his/sher/its> torso.

*You run one of your fine sabres right through the &lt;victim>, and &lt;he/she/it> stands, bleeding profusely, for a few seconds before collapsing lifelessly.

*You plunge one of your &lt;weapon> into the &lt;victim>.  As it is withdrawn, &lt;he/she/it> examines the place where &lt;his/her/its> &lt;body part> used to be before slumping over lifelessly.

*As the &lt;victim> is impaled on your &lt;weapon>, &lt;his/her/its> innards burst from &lt;his/her/its> body like grisly fireworks.  At least &lt;he/she/it> made an impression on the way out.

*You launch a powerful attack with your &lt;weapon>.  The &lt;victim> stares blankly into the distance, this expression made convenient by the hole where your &lt;weapon> just was, and earlier, where an eye used to be.

*You drive your &lt;weapon> into the &lt;victim>'s chest, impaling &lt;his/her/its> vital organs before it bursts out the other side in a shower of gore.

*You pin the &lt;victim>'s right hand with the point of your &lt;weapon>, before smashing the butt end across &lt;his/her/its> body, leaving &lt;him/her/it> open for the killing blow which quickly follows. 

*&lt;Victim> looks down at the &lt;weapon> protruding from &lt;his/her/its> chest in horrified surprise, then back up at you, before the consequences catch up to &lt;him/her/it> and &lt;he/she/it> slumps lifelessly to the ground.

Impaling Trolls may sometimes result in a troll-specific message {{research}}

*Your &lt;weapon> travels halfway through the &lt;troll> before getting stuck in the stone.  the &lt;troll> looks triumphant, but only for a moment before &lt;he/she/it> cracks into &lt;number of> pieces.

*Managing to find a crack in the &lt;victim's> skin, you plunge your &lt;weapon> right into &lt;him/her>, fatally wounding &lt;him/her>.

*As your &lt;weapon> is driven into &lt;him/her/it>, the &lt;troll> lurches back and forth, as if deciding whether to go left or right.  Finally, &lt;he/she/it> splits the difference, breaking apart instead.


As seems to also be the case with trees {{research}}

*You drive your &lt;weapon> into the large pine's trunk.  The bark around it splinters and snaps.  The large pine freezes for a moment, looking far less animate as it dies.

=== Content from Inform ===
The '''inform''' command lets you be informed of various events, causing you to be sent a short message when they happen.

==Syntax==
&lt;code>inform&lt;/code> by itself will list the events you're currently being informed of, and the events you're not currently being informed of but could be.

&lt;code>inform &lt;string>&lt;/code> -- e.g. &lt;code>inform friend&lt;/code> -- will toggle informs for a specific type of event.  So, if you're not currently being informed of that event, it will turn it on, and if you are, it will turn it off.

==Available informs==
First, there's the set of informs that everyone has available to them:
*logon: informs you when someone logs on or off.
*new-player: informs you when someone logs on for the first time
*birthday: informs you when someone logs in on their [[birthday]], if they have set it
*council: 
*friend: informs you when someone on your [[friends]] list logs on or off.
*guild-logon: informs you when someone in the same [[guild]] and specialization logs on or off.
*cpu: sends you periodic informs about cpu usage, fault rate, lag, reclaimed objects&lt;!--I have no idea what this means, but it's one of the messages.  Possibly when buried etc. objects are destroyed? --~~~~ -->, and cleaning idle rooms&lt;!--Not sure what THAT is, either.  Unloading rooms? -->
*achievement: informs you when someone gets an [[achievement]] of at least "moderate" level, or when a new achievement is added to the game
*blog: informs you when a new post is made on one of the [https://discworld.starturtle.net/lpc/blog/blog.c developer blogs]
*event: informs you when a new [[event]] is added, or when it's almost time for an existing one to start
*group-request: informs you when someone makes a [[group]] request
*roleplaying: informs you when someone uses the [[Roleplaying (command)|roleplaying command]] to add or remove themselves from the list of active roleplayers.

[[Witch]]es also get a special inform, "mockery".  This lets them see what other witches say when [[mock]]ing.
